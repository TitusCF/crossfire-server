Configuring and installing the plugin_logger V0.1

System requirements:

 -> crossfire with plugins support
 -> the source of the archetypes located in ../lib/arch/
    If your don't have them, you must download them from crossfire repository
 -> an ODBC library and its developpement header (sql.h, sqlext.h, sqltypes.h)
 -> A database and it's ODBC driver
    note: At the time i'm writing those line only postgersql and
          MySql are suported within the web interface because php
          seems to have trouble accessing database using ODBC 
 -> web server
 -> php with libgd support
    (libgd is used to support pictures creation within php)

Installing:

A) the plugin itself

  1) Be sure your system has ODBC configured in it
     On unix systems, this can be done by installing libunixODBC and libunixODBC-devel.
  2) Create a database using your prefered database system.
     Ensure it has odbc support (mysql and postgresql have)
  3) Using the ODBC tools create a DSN (Database Server Name) and test it.
     Testing on systems with unixodbc is done by invoking the following command
         isql DSN username password
  4) write down the DSNname, the username and the password to access the database
  5) edit include/plugin_logging.h and change the parameters to fit your system
     Most important ones are those used to access database (DSN and so on)
     and those used to know where your web pages are located (usually /var/www/html/crossfire)
  6) use any sql tool to create the tables listed in database.txt
     Further developpements will include a tool to do it for you.
     'Till it's done, do it yourself....
  7) Edit the top of Makefile to fit your crossfire and apache configuration
  8) type
         make
         make install
  9) Replace the player_changer.arc file in the source arch tree with the one
     provided in this directory. Rebuild and reinstall the archetypes
  10)Reset the crossfire server

B) The web interface

  1) Edit the top of html/crossfire/database.php to fit your database system
  2) Edit the top of Makefile to fit you system configuration
  3) Type
         make pictures
     which will gather all the pictures from the ../lib/arch directory
  4) Type
         make html_install

That's all guys...
