IMPORTANT MAINTENANCE INFORMATION

The files in this directory (newclient.h in particular) are controlled in the
server/include/shared directory.  The copy of these files found in the
client/common/shared directory is the result of use of an svn:externals
property to allow the client and server to use the same information to help
assure synchonization.  The GTK-V2 client to interpret data that the server
sends to it.

If the server/include/shared directory files are modified, for the client to
get the changes,  the following must be done.

1) Commit the change.
2) Note the revision number of the prior commit.
3) Update the svn:externals property of client/common to specify the new
   revision number of the server/include/shared commit.

If the client/common/shared directory files are modified and committed from a
client checkout of the crossfire source tree, in SVN, it is actually the
server/include/shared files that are changed.  If the svn:externals property of
client/common is not updated as noted above, upon the next svn update, the
client/common/shared directory contents will revert and the change in the
client area of the SVN checkout will be lost.
