/**
 * The current implementation of crossfire is not very thread
 * friendly/safe - in fact, metaserver2 is the first part to
 * use an extra thread.
 * As such, it would be a lot of work to add the necessary
 * locks in the rest of the code for the metaserver2 to be able
 * to get the data it needs.  So instead, we use this
 * MS2UpdateInfo structure to get the data from the main thread
 * to the metaserver thread - basically, the main thread
 * gets a lock on the mutex, updates the fields in this structure
 * and releases the lock.  The metaserver2 thread will
 * get a lock when it needs to get this information, copy
 * it to the post form, then unlock the structure.
 * In that way, neither side holds the lock very long, which is especially
 * important because the metaserver2 thread could take quite a while
 * to do its updates.
