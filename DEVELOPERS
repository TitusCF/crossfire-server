The main purpose of this file is to try to reduce duplicate effort,
and to know who worked on what.

If you have CVS access and are doing work/plan to do work, please update
this file accordingly.  A brief description of what you plan to do
is useful, so others working in that area can know who to contact.

Subject: [CF-Devel] CVS repository moved.
Date: Thu, 22 Feb 2001 21:21:31 -0800

 The cvs repository is now installed on sourceforge.

 If you do not have any changes in your checked out tree, the easiest thing to
do is just do a new checkout.  See http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=13833
for information on setup.

 If you want to reparent your tree, do the following:

1) Create a /tmp/Root file with the new repository information.  The contents
ofmine looks like:
:ext:mwedel@cvs.crossfire.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/crossfire

 Everything but the login name (mwedel) should be the same for anyone else.

2) Update all the Root entries in your cvs tree.  To do that, run
find . -name Root -exec cp /tmp/Root {} \;
This is best run from the the relevant directory (arch, crossfire, maps,
client).  IF you have all those and nothing checked out in a common directory,
you could run it from there.

3) Update the repository information.  Use the perl script I provide - its
useage is update_rp <dirname> - if run from the parent dir, it would be arch,
crossfire, maps, client, as above.  If withing the arch, ... dirs, then just
use.
