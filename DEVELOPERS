This file is probably way out of date.  I have updated it (11-9-97) to
the best of my knowledge.  To get added/removed from this file, please
send me (mark@pyramid.com) a mail specifically mentioning this file.
The main purpose of this file is to try to reduce duplicate effort,
and to know who worked on what.

Peter Mardahl <peterm@eecs.berkeley.edu> runes, new spells, changing
	of spell parameters, new archetypes
Brian Thomas (thomas@astro.psu.edu)- Skills, alchemy, altars

	interested in working on client side (user interface)

	spell paths, and gifts.
