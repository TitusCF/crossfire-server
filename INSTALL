Directions for installation:

Note: Crossfire uses a great deal of floating point, and expects the syntax
to be 'x.y'.  In some environments, the language may be dfferent, so that
the format for floats is 'x,y' or something similar.  If this is the
situation for you, you need to change your environment so that floats are in
the 'x.y' format.

1) You need to meet the following requirements:
  A) 3 to 5 Megabytes of free disk space for object files (note that
  uncompress map files will take a lot more)
  B) A compiler that understands ANSI.

  If you don't meet both these requirements, you will be unable to proceed
  further.

2) Run the 'configure' script.  You will need to supply a -prefix=path
   for the program to install into unless you want the files in
   /usr/games/crossfire.

   By default, it will create a var, share, bin & man directory in the path
   provided.  share, bin, and man can in theory be read-only, var needs
   to be read/write.  There are many files in the share directory, so
   I don't suggest it be shared with other programs.

   The standard configure options can be given to specify a location
   (--prefix=/path, --datadir=/path, --bindir, --localstatedir and --mandir).
   are: --prefix=/usr/games/crossfire, --datadir=/usr/games/crossfire/share
   --bindir=/usr/games/crossfire/bin, and --mandir=/usr/games/crossfire/man,
   --localstatedir=/usr/games/crossfire/var

   Note that the default bin and man directories are fairly non standard
   and are usually not searched by the standard PATH and MANPATH
   environmental variables.  It may be desirable to set these to a more
   standard location.  There is no requirement that all the subdirectories
   fall into the same overall directory structure (bin could be /usr/bin,
   man could be /usr/local/man, datadir /usr/games/crossfire, and 
   localstatedir could be /var/crossfire.

   If you plan to run multiple crossfire servers, all directories except the
   localstatedir can be shared between all the servers.  localstatedir
   should be unique to each server.  This will cause each server to have
   their own unique player files as well as highscore.  You can try using a
   common localstatedir, but there is no guarantee it will work, and any
   problems reported related to such a configuration are likely to be
   ignored.

   All file paths should start with '/'.  Don't use relative filepaths.

   The configure step should create all the necesary makefiles.  Look
   at the output and note any errors - if you get errors during the
   configure stage, there is little point in going further

   If you want the python plugin support, you will likely need to
   add the --with-includes=-I/usr/include/pythonX.Y, where X.Y will vary
   depending on the version of python installed on your system.

3) Edit include/config.h.
   Most options should be fairly well commented.
   The default config.h file has pretty sane values, and can be used unchanged.

4) Compile the program:  type 'make'.  It should take a little while.  If you
   get errors that abort the compile, copy them down (either using cut and
   paste, or redirect the output of the compile to a file), and send those to
   the bug alias (crossfire-devel@listserv.real-time.com), along with what
   machine type & OS you are using.  Also, include the compile line with its
   various options.  A message saying 'it failed to compile main.c' tells me
   little, and I can not fix problems with that little detail.

5) Install the program by running 'make install'

6) Crossfire requires maps installed into the directory specified by
   --datadir (or the default).  Maps are a seperate distribution available on
   the ftp server.  The maps can be unpacked directly into the location
   specified by --datadir.  All the map files need to be readable by which
   ever uid is running the server - if multiple people will be running
   servers, the map permissions may need to get updated.

7) It might be useful to edit "share/crossfire/motd" (MessageOfToDay) file.

8) If you want your server to be publically advertised to interested
    players, edit the share/crossfire/settings file.  The metaserver host
    and port are accurate - your host and comment should be updated.

9) By default, the installation process assumes that only one user id
    will actually be used to run the game, and directory and file permissions
    are set as such.  If multiple users will run the game, permissions on
    many files will need to be updated (lib/bookarch, lib/unique_items,
    lib/players, lib/temp.maps, and perhaps other).

COMMON PROBLEMS:

P) The server complains that ../lib/unique-items/??? does not exist, and
the game crashes shortly there after.

S) Just create the directory.  It should be created by the make install
process, however, if installing by hand, it may be missing. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P) It can't find the file stdarg.h, and thus the compile fails.

S) If using gcc, stdarg.h should be installed as part of the normal
installation (with fixincludes).  If it is missing, gcc was not installed
correctly.

It is also possible that you are using an old version of gcc that does not
have stdarg as part of its include files.  Newer versions have this
file.

If not using gcc, stdarg.h should be provided by your vendor - if you lack
this file, you are probably lacking an ANSI-C compiler.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P) I am using Openwindows (or perhaps other windowing system), and
during the compiling of crossedit, it complains about it not being
able to find some header files, like Xaw/Panner.h

S) This is a problem in Openwindows 2, in which those header files
are not included (I don't think the library is either).  The only solution
is to upgrade to another windowing system (X11R5, X11R6, or Openwindows
3).

The other solution is just to not compile crossedit.  It is not needed
to play the game, only to edit/create maps.  To do this, you remove
the crossedit entry from the SUBDIRS line, and go back to stage
3 of the make process (where you make all the Makefiles).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P) I can not save characters.

S) 
1) The player save directory was not created.  make install will create
this directory, but if you did not use make install, this could be the
problem.  You can create the directory by hand by doing
'mkdir LIBDIR/players', where LIBDIR is the library directory
that you set in crosssite.def

2) The save directory's permissions are not set properly for the uid/gid
that crossfire is running under.  Situtation that may have caused
this is that 'mark' installed the program, but 'frank' is running
the program, either at the shell prompt, or because the program
has been chmod u+s with frank's id.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P) I have problems compiling on HP/UX systems.

S) Use gcc - the standard cc with HP/UX apparantly will not compile
crossfire correctly.

Other problems?  See the section REPORTING BUGS in the README file.  Follow
all instructions there when submitting a bug report.  If you do not, and
provide insufficient information for me to help out, I will likely just mail
you back telling you to follow those instructions.
