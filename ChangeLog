Changes in top level SVN tree.  A few notes when putting entries in this
file:
1) Please include a date in the form yyyy-mm-dd (yes, us americans are 
screwed up relative to most the world, but some consistent date format
is needed for this file.)
2) You don't need to go into exacting detail of the changes.  This file
is mostly meant to give an idea to others what has changed - you don't
need to recreate the code here.  If you change fixes a reported bug
on the mailing list, please provide a brief description of the bug
fixed.  But please do try to include a useful description of
what changed.  Saying something like 'General cleanup - just whitespace
changes' is much more useful than 'misc edits' or 'code cleanup'.
3) Please include your name with the changes you make.
4) Whenever making an update, please update this file, no matter how
small - this just lets others know that the file has changed if nothing
else.  With this, include the file(s) that you changed.

server/rune.c: If skill is NULL in dispel_rune(), just return as server
  will otherwise crash in trap_disarm()
server/spell_util.c: Fix bug in that runes that hold other spells (glyphs,
   firetraps, magic runes, etc) do not find a skill object, and thus
   player doesn't get exp.  Instead, for runes, try to find owner, and
   then the relevant skill object.

Fix for bug #1547517: DM issue with containers
server/apply.c: move_apply shouldn't exit if opened container.
Ryo 2006-10-29

Update code so everything uses draw_ext_info(), and remove new_draw_info().
For the most part, everything is just a simple update of function name/
parameters.  In some places, there was some other cleanup, like
inconsistent whitespace being made consistent.  A few places were
changed to use the varargs version, so no longer needed a local snprintf.
Many places where used to remove the hard formatting (combine several
calls into one so that the client can do the word wrap/formatting, since
assuming the width of the client never was really accurate)
Dead code was removed, rather than being updated.
For old clients, it will continue to use the old protocol commands, so
this doesn't break client compatibility in any way.

Implement feature request #1551406: Add player's name to disease symptoms
 server/disease.c: add player's name.
Ryo 2006-10-28

/plugins/cfpython/{cfpython.c, cfpython_map.c, cfpython_object.c}: Remove
   redundent checks in values passed to Crossfire_Foobar_wrap() functions.
Alex Schultz 2006-10-27

Fix for bug #1573381 (death attacks does works on skull)
server/attack.c: check for undead when no slaying set for hitter in deathstrike_player.
Ryo 2006-10-22

Fix for bug #1553636 (Crashbug: reset/swaped map after use of "overlay_save").
Make command coherent with ingame command (command_overlay_save since overlay_save).
Add 'overlay_reset' command to reset a saved overlay.
common/map.c: if flag is 2, map is still valid (non destructive save).
include/sproto.h: rename function, new function.
server/c_wiz.c: no need to save and reload the map for overlay. Rename function. New function.
server/commands.c: rename function, new function.
Ryo 2006-10-22

common/loader.l: Make it so that long msg/endmsg won't overflow temp buffer
  by using safe_strcat.  Will result in long messages being truncated, but
  better than crashes.
server/pets.c: Check for existance of object existance after call to
  follow_owner() in remove_all_pets().  Can be cases where put is killed
  when moving to new map.
MSW 2006-10-18

server/apply.c: If the captain of a transport exits the transport, make the
   next player on the transport the captain.
server/server.c: Like change to apply.c to make player another player captain
   if one leaves the game.  But in addition, in all cases, we need to clean
   up the transport->contr pointer, which will otherwise cause crashes.
MSW 2006-10-12

common/readable.c: Rewrite god_info_msg() - a buffer overflow crash was seen
  on metalforge, and the old code had lots of dangerous string operations
  (non safe strcats, sprintf with overlapping buffers).  No code is
  functionally equivalant, just uses safe string funtions.
MSW 2006-10-12

doc/Developers/objects updated to better describe @match use in objects. Many
objects contain useless case handling keys like @match Hello|hello because
mapmakers do not know how @match works.  Also add mention of the limited
regular expression support that applies to match keys.
Kevin R. Bulgrien 2006-10-08

Make converters inside shops work again.
---
server/c_object.c: Sell item after dropping because converters do not accept
   unpaid items.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-10-08

Fix bug where in players could unequip cursed weapons by switching to a hand
to hand skill (punching, karate, etc).
--
include/define.h: Add AP_NOPRINT flag.
server/apply.c: Modify the apply_special() code to take AP_NOPRINT option,
   which as implies, causes messages not to be printed.  Used in change
   to skill_util.c, since the code thre prints better message about uequipping
   of weapon.
server/skill_util.c: Do some cleanup of unused vars in do_skill().  Modify
   attack_hth() to call apply_special() to unequip weapon (that takes care
   of checking cursed status, etc).
--
MSW 2006-10-05

server/rune.c: Fix mistake in revision 4979, causing get_rangevector to be called
    with an uninitialized env.
Alex Schultz 2006-10-04

server/c_misc.c: Fix incorrect use of FMT64 in commant_statistics().
Alex Schultz 2006-10-02

   two-line format. Fix a possible buffer overflow when players talk to
   certain NPCs.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-10-02

server/rune.c: Cleanup spring_trap() and clean some questionable logic.
server/attack.c: Cause spell traps to be triggered when containers with traps
   are destroyed by a spell effect.

   utils/crossloop.tmpl.in, utils/crossloop.web.in, utils/crossloop.pl.tmpl.in,
   doc/crossfire-server.man: Rename crossfire binary to crossfire-server. Make
   changes to account for that in crossloop and the man page.
Alex Schultz 2006-09-20

server/plugins.c: Change cfapi_object_say() to use either command_say() or
   npc_say() depending on if the object is a player. Fixes bug #1534889.
server/monster.c, include/sproto: Move code for NPCs to talk from the code that
   handles NPC replies into npc_say().
server/spell_effect.c: Implement proposed alchemy changes from the mailing list.
   Make value of nuggets given range from 5% to 40%. Depends on archetype
   changes to the alchemy spell and nuggets. (Without archetype changes will
   give obscenely low value.)
server/spell_util.c, include/sproto.h: Make min_casting_level() non-static.
Alex Schultz 2006-09-16

server/alchemy.c: Make shadow alchemy and random alchemy failures ignore the
   'cauldron' type being used. Fixes bug #1551385.
Alex Schultz 2006-09-15

   based on addition of is_in_shop() in cf+ by elmex.

   the transport.

 random_maps/rproto.h wall.c 
Ryo 2006-09-04

Bulk of this change is updating some files to use draw_ext_info() - all
   future code should use this, since there is no real reason not to and
   it provides additional features.  One notable change - reversed the
   order of the new and old formats in draw_ext_info_format() - the
   order was different than that of draw_ext_info(), which leads to confusion.
   draw_ext_info_format() wasn't used in many places, so easier to change
   that than all the draw_ext_info() calls.  Only another 1200
   new_draw_info calls left in the server.
--
doc/mediaTags: Fix some typos, clarify some behaviour (the way it works
   now so that there will not be confusion in the future).
include/define.h: Remove MSG_ tags - moved to newclient.h
include/newclient.h: Synchronize with client version.  Add MSG_ defines
include/newserver.h: Move some defines from here to newclient.h
server/apply.c:  Reverse format parameters to draw_ext_info_format() calls.
server/c_misc.c: Rewrite to use draw_ext_info{_format} - this allows nice
   formatting of tables, etc.  Also general style cleanups, clarify some
   messages.  in help_topics(), don't do linewrap - let the client
   handle it.  remove bug_report() function - no longer used.  Remove
   explore_mode() - wasn't used.  Move command_style_map_info() to
   c_wiz.c since it is a wiz only command.
server/c_wiz.c: As per above, move command_style_map_info() to this file
   since it is a wiz command.
server/player.c: Reverse format parameters to draw_ext_info_format() calls.
server/shop.c: Update to use draw_ext_info{_format} instead of new_draw_info()
socket/info.c: Reverse format parameters in draw_ext_info_format().
   Update va_start() to use new last parameter.  Remove call to
   strip_media() if the client supports the tag - that should only be
   used if the client does not support the tag.
socket/request.c: remove commented out MSG_TYPE values.
MSW 2006-09-03

plugins/common/hashtable.c: make Win32 define of uintptr_t more correct.
Alex Schultz  2006-09-03

plugins/common/hashtable.c: fix Win32 compilation.
server/spell_effect.c: missing return value.

 not found, set del_event to NULL. And don't dare you call remove_ob on it! :)
 plugins/cfpython/cfpython_object.c
----
Fix for bug #1551371 (No-magic prevents monsters from casting spells)
 server/skill_util.c: ignore no_spell/no_magic for monsters.
----
Fix for bug #1551386 (Alchemy with unpaid items).
 include/sproto.h: new function declaration.
 server/alchemy.c: check for unpaid items/cauldrons in new function.
 server/skill_util.c: move alchemy code to other function.
Ryo 2006-09-03

server/attack.c: Store away victim_map in hit_with_arrow() - what could
  otherwise happen is that victim is a player, and killed and ends up
  on new map, so that victim->map points at the wrong map.
MSW 2006-09-02

server/swamp.c: swamp will now kill players with woodsman, but slower than
 players without that skill. Feature request #1539125 by Andreas Kirschbaum.
socket/lowlevel.c: apply patch #1550716 (Frequent crashes after client disconnects)
 courtesy Mark Kidder
Ryo 2006-09-02

server/attack.c:  Move kill_player() after we set up the pl->killer string.
  Needed just so right message is on grave stone - also prevents crashes,
  as if the hitter is poison or disease, kill_player() will remove those.
MSW 2006-08-30

lib/attackmess: Fix missing space in a 'type 17' attack message.
Alex Schultz 2006-08-30

common/map.c: static buffers are evil. This resulted in name weirdness, and
 strange results with overlays.
Ryo 2006-08-25

server/server.c: fix a weird name change. Basically, function path_combine_and_normalize
 was called twice while first result was still in use, resulting in weird names.
Ryo 2006-08-23

 socket/request.c: special case for view's center.
Ryo 2006-08-22

Fix/improve login procedure such that if a player is trying to log in with
the name & correct password of character already on server, terminate old 
connection and let them log in.
---
server/login.c: Remove name check for players on server in check_name().
    Make wrong_password() to handle error message handling for wrong password
    In check_login(), iterate over players on system to see if there is a
    match - if mismatched password, print error.  If correct password,
    terminate old connection.  Move wrong password logic from check_login()
    to wrong_password().
MSW 2006-08-21

 server/login.c
Ryo 2006-08-08

Implement feature request #821645 (change password command). This introduces 3 new
 player states, "entering current password", "new password", "confirm new password".
include/define.h: new states.
include/player.h: add new_password field.
include/sproto.h: new command prototype.
server/c_misc.c: new command.
server/commands.c: bind command.
socket/request.c: handle new states.
Ryo 2006-08-08

Implement feature request #1528641 (consecrate should change face of altar). This simply
 removes the altar, and add the god's altar. Note that the name of the altar should be
 altar_<god's name>, which seems to be the case everywhere.

    to avoid creating more python wrapper objects than is needed.
Alex Schultz 2006-07-29

common/object.c: fix bug #1526364 (stacking Royal Guards). Use find_free_spot
 to place dropped items if living. Also fix indent of function free_object2.
server/c_object.c: fix bug #1529969 (shop floor not working in random maps).
Ryo 2006-07-29

server/c_wiz.c: fix addexp not working on skills.
server/time.c: don't crash if duplicator doesn't have other_arch set.
Ryo 2006-07-28

plugins/common/hashtable.c, plugins/common/include/hashtable.h, 
    plugins/common/Makefile.am, plugins/common/include/Makefile.am,
    plugins/cfpython/Makefile.am: Add hashtable.c, to add ptr-to-ptr hash tables
    for plugins to use. (Useful to use a cf object as a key for the table)
plugins/cfpython/include/cfpython.h: Include compile.h which Python.h doesn't
    include on it's own in versions of python older than 2.4.
include/plugin.h, common/object.c: Add EVENT_DESTROY, a local event triggered when
    an object is freed.
include/funcpoint.h, crossedit/stubs.c, random_maps/standalone.c,
    test/unit/common/stubs_common.c: Allow execute_event to be called from common
    and add appropriate stubs.
Alex Schultz 2006-07-28

common/item.c: In describe_item() correct capacity description of large
   (>1000 maxsp) Glowing Crystals.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-07-28

plugins/cfpython/cfpython.c: Added compilePython() function to split the compiling
    of python bytecode from the execution of it. Add support for caching the
    bytecode for a fixed number of scripts (default of 16) to increase speed.
Alex Schultz 2006-07-27

server/c_wiz.c: prevent a DM to reset a random map if (s)he is on that map.
    Workaround for bug #1528173.
Yann Chachkoff 2006-07-26

server/c_wiz.c: call update_ob_speed if removed object is animated.
server/spell_attack.c: stop generating swarm/bullet if player moved. This
 fixes bug #1528194.
server/spell_util.c: don't report blocking if caster is not player. It then
 is a swarm spell or equivalent, so position is random, no need to warn.
Ryo 2006-07-25

server/server.c: Select op->facing instead of op->direction in process_events
    for players and monsters as the direction reference for the face to display.
    Fix for bug #1528182. (*few* ! that's a lot of bugs ! :))
server/spell_util.c: Make the search for a friendly target for some spells also
    browse transports located in the square from which the spell was cast.
    This is a fix for bug #1528018
server/c_wiz.c: Prevents the use of reset on self-map while in a transport.
    Work-around for bug #1528172.
server/skill_util.c: Make dragons prefer clawing over anything else as unarmed
    combat technique. Fix for bug #1528197
Yann Chachkoff 2006-07-25

common/treasure.c: Added explicit item_power calculation for generated items that
    got an item_power of 0 - should solve bug #1460354.
Yann Chachkoff 2006-07-21

scommon/map.c: Add check to block_linked() to make sure things never block themself.
server/spell_attack.c: Target the head of monsters diseases are cast at.
Alex Schultz 2006-07-18

Fix player count reporting to the metaserver. It now excludes connections with
not-yet-logged-in players and AFK/WIZ/BOT players.
---
socket/metaserver.c: In metaserver_update() use the same conditions as for the
   who command.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-07-16

server/spell_effect.c, include/global.h, common/init.c, server/init.c: Add 
    setting "create_home_portals" which allows server admins to allow town
    portals to be created in apartments. Based on a patch by pippijn in the
    cf-ext project.
lib/settings: Set default create_home_portals to FALSE
Alex Schultz 2006-07-12

lib/regions: Fix typo in region "portjoseph". Bug #1518392 (Port Joseph
   region spelling inconsistent with map directory) by Kevin R. Bulgrien.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-07-07

acinclude.m4, configure: Fix last fix which discarded any passed in
   CFLAGS or if that is set in the environment.
MSW 2006-07-05

common/button.c: Fix for sourceforge bug common/button.c - harpsicord crashes
   client.  The problem is that the trigger code presumed that the object
   would be animated, and blindly set teh face to the second animation frame.
   harpsicords are not animated, so this could amount to garbage.  So add
   check for trigger objects to see if they are in fact animated before
   blindly setting the face.
MSW 2006-07-05

server/daemon.c: Patch by wart, tracker 1489902 - open a file like /dev/null
   to then dup - this fixes -detach crash problem.  Might be better to use
   some other file, but in theory, shouldn't be much going here, and I
   don't think we can safely use a file that is already opened by the
   server.
MSW 2006-07-05

common/region.c: wrong order for memset call.
Ryo 2006-07-04

common/object.c: revert my previous fix, it's actually a feature :)
Ryo 2006-06-27

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 1.9.1:

acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure, configure.ac:  Fix crossedit header
  detection - even when passed --with-x to configure and having all the files,
  it wouldn't find the headers because it didn't pass in the correct -I
  options for where they sit.   Also, update for 1.9.1 release.
MSW 2006-06-29

server/rune.c: Undo last patch - breaks summoning runes.
server/skills.c: Change disarm logic - after first failure, don't continue
  to disarm traps (makes sense anyways - can really only disarm one thing
  at a time) - this fixes the problem that last change to rune.c tried
  to fix.
MSW 2006-06-27

server/rune.c: Patch from schmorp - when dealing with traps, don't put them
  underneath the player when a disarm failure happens, instead, update the
  direction to hit the player - prevents a recursion problems causing
  hundreds of objects.
MSW 2006-06-25

common/object.c: don't consider FLAG_INV_LOCKED for can_merge.
Ryo 2006-06-24

common/object.c: in insert_ob_in_map() don't stop processing flying objects
  if the object also has floor set.  This fixes crashes when an object
  is both flying and has floor set.
MSW 2006-06-06

Add commands rules and news to display the rules/news files.
---
include/sproto.h: Add prototypes for new commands.
lib/help/{motd,news,rules}: Add help files.
lib/Makefile.am: Add new help files.
lib/Makefile.in: Rebuilt.
server/c_misc: Add functions to implement the commands.
server/commands: Add new commands to commands list.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-06-06

Fix problem with create food when used on transports.  Rather than put a
  specific check in the create food code, modify insert_ob_in_map to
  check to see of the passed in originator is on a transport, and if so,
  find out the right info - this probably fixes the same type of bug that
  happens from other areas of the code.
common/object.c: Above change, as well as #if 0 out some unused functions.
MSW 2006-06-04

Clean up some compiler warnings.  Most of the changes are related to replaced
 %lld with FMT64 defines so that the format will be correct, no matter if
 the 64 bit type is a long, long long, or if this is windows.  #if 0 out a 
 bunch of code that isn't used.
--
common/exp.c: Replaced lld with FMT64
common/holy.c: #if 0 out baptize_altar().  Add banner copyright at top of file.
common/info.c, common/item.c, common/loader.l, common/loader.c, common/map.c:
   common/porting.c Replaced lld with FMT64

   Update various sprintf appropriately.
include/global.h: Add FMT64 and FMT64U as appropriate for different systems.
   Change max_time to be a uint32
include/sockproto.h, include/sproto.h: rebuilt
server/apply.c: #if 0 out monster_apply_special
server/c_range.c: Add != 0 in assignment if statement - same meaning, clearer
   on intention and avoids compiler warning.
server/c_wiz.c: Update command_kick() to take const char.  Update command_speed()
   to operate properly based on max_time being a uint32.  Update various lld
   to FMT64.  Clarify ambiguous if/if/else statement in command_insert_into()
server/commands.c: Add cast to command_kick for new function prototype.  #if 
   0 out find_command(), parse_string(), parse_command()
server/disease.c: #if 0 out find_disease(), reduce_symptoms()
server/egoitem.c: #if 0 out create_artifact().  Add copyright at top of file.
server/gods.c: #if 0 out get_god()
server/hiscore.c: Replace lld with FMT64
server/login.c: #if 0 out create_savedir_if_needed()
server/resurrection.c: Replace lld with FMT64.  #if 0 out dead_character() and
    dead_player_exists()
server/server.c: Remove info_keys() - hasn't been used in a long time.  #if 0
   out process_active_maps()
server/skill_util.c: Replace lld with FMT64
server/spell_util.c: #if 0 out check_spell_effect()
server/weather.c: #if 0 out feather_map().  Fix what I suspect is an error
   in worldmap_to_weathermap() to skip over starting slashes.
socket/image.c: Add a fair number of char * casts to suppress warnings.
socket/init.c: Change buflen in init_connection() to socklen_t to match
   function prototype.  Add some char * casts.
socket/loop.c: Add some char * casts.

MSW 2006-06-04

Add a name 'dungeon_name' for random maps, and put it in the random key's name.
 This implements feature request #815622 (keys in random maps should note map they are from)
 https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=815622&group_id=13833&atid=363833

random_maps/random_map.c: fix a memory leak. Add random name.
random_maps/reader.[cl]: read 'dungeon_name'. Use strncpy instead of strcpy.
random_maps/random_map.h: add new field, use a #define instead of hardcoded constant.

Do not merge renamed items with differing custom names.
---
common/object.c: In can_merge() check for differing custom_name field.
server/c_object.c: In command_rename_item() try to merge the affected item.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-06-02

Do not merge locked and unlocked items.
---
common/object.c: In can_merge() do not ignore FLAG_INV_LOCKED anymore.
socket/item.c: In lock_item_cmd() try to merge the affected item.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-06-01

lib/artifacts: Fix typo to not anymore generate "boots of of steel".
lib/artifacts: Fix typo to make bows of Sorig work.
lib/archetypes, lib/treasures.bld: Rebuilt.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-06-01

Various bug fixes, related to the new map display code.
common/loader.c, common/loader.l: Add map_layer attribute so object can
   override what layer it should go on (fix for levitation boots).
common/map.c: Add support for map_layer to override layering.  Fix bug
   where if there were more objects than would fit on a layer, not all
   would be drawn (same object was duplicated onto multiple layers).
common/object.c: Add check for ob->map_layer in can_merge()
include/map.h: Add extern declaration for map_layer_name[]
include/object.h: Add map_layer to object.
socket/request.c:  In map1 compatibility mode, make sure we always
   send the player.
MSW 2006-05-29

server/monster.c: Only call animate_object() if object is animated -
    otherwise, animate_object() spews bunch of error about being called
    with non animated object.
MSW 2006-05-29


Monsters now cannot anymore see through earthwalls/monsters. This restores the
behavior to what it was before the new movement code. For players this
basically means that monsters will not anymore cast spells though earthwalls or
other monsters.
---
server/player.c: In path_to_player() consider tiles with P_IS_ALIVE set as
   blocking.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-05-27

Make attacking with melee in 'fire command work again. Now attacking with
<shift>+<direction> works again.
---
server/skill_util.c: In skill_attack() also attack if the destination tile has
   P_IS_ALIVE set.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-05-27

Make swarm spells work again. These spells did not work anymore on tiles which
had a move_block type set (for example cobblestones).
---
server/spell_attack.c: In move_swarm_spell() remove check for blocked
   movement. This check was incorrect since it did check the SPELL object
   instead of the SPELL_EFFECT object. Also, this check is not necessary since
   it is also present in the called functions fire_xxx().
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-05-25

Fix monster not changing direction when attacking adjacent object.
 server/monster.c: update facing/direction according to enemy.
Ryo 2006-05-25

common/item.c: Skip some processing if NEW_MATERIAL_CODE is undefined.
common/holy.c, include/libproto.h: Declare some functions as "static".
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-05-21

Make socket handling more robust.
---
include/newclient.h: Split MAXSOCKBUF into MAXSOCKRECVBUF and MAXSOCKSENDBUF.
   Increase the receive buffer size to be able to handle all valid packets;
   decrease send buffer size to 10239 to not overflow the receive buffer of old
   clients.
socket/{image.c,info.c,init.c,item.c,loop.c,lowlevel.c,request.c,sounds.c}: Use
   renamed constants.
socket/image.c: In send_image_sums() prevent buffer overflows. Reject the
   command instead.
socket/request.c: In send_skill_info() and send_spell_paths() prevent buffer
   overflows. Instead send only as much information as fits into the buffer.
socket/loop.c: In handle_client() prevent possible array out-of-bounds access.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-05-21

Added a 'cf_log' function for plugins. Replace printf in plugins with correct call.
---
include/plugin.h: include required header for log level definitions.
include/sproto.h: new function.
plugins/cfanim/cfanim.c: replace printf with calls to cf_log.
plugins/cfpython/cfpython.c: replace printf with calls to cf_log.
plugins/cfpython/cfpython_map.c: replace printf with calls to cf_log.
plugins/common/plugin_common.c: new cf_log function.
plugins/common/include/plugin_common.h: new cf_log function.
server/plugins.c: new hook.
Ryo 2006-05-20

This adds a "bot" flag for players. Such players won't be counted when
 sending information to metaserver. To enable it, just send "bot 1"
 through the "setup" command.
---
include/newserver.h: add new is_bot flag.
lib/settings: add %b to default formats.
server/c_misc.c: add %b to who options, for [BOT] flag.
socket/init.c: init is_bot.
socket/metaserver.c: don't count bots.
socket/request.c: new "bot" setup command.
Ryo 2006-05-20

This commit adds support for the map2 protocol command (10 layer map).
This changes how the data is stored and sent to the client.  This also
implements the idea of client handling map animations, so adds some object
flags so that the server knows if it should let the client handle animations
or not.  Support for the original map protocol command is removed.
---
aclocal.m4: rebuilt
configure.ac: Add checks for zlib.h, libz - not used right now, but will
   probably be used in the future, so no reason to remove it.
common/loader.l: Add client_anim_sync, client_anim_random FLAGS.
common/map.c: Add add_face_layer() to set face for a layer.   Redo/simplify
   update_position to store faces away based on layering criteria.
common/time.c: Replace long pticks with a uint32, since size of a long will
   vary, and we now send pticks to the client as a 32 bit value.
crossedit/CrEdit.c: Update the draw logic based on the fact there are more
   layers now.
crossedit/Edit.c: Comment out some code that probably should be fixed.
   Replace calls of SET_MAP_FACE with SET_MAP_FACE_OBJ
doc/Developers/protocol: Updated with map2, tick protocol additions.
   Reorganize the parameters in the setup protocol command so they are now
   listed in alphabetical order.
include/autoconf.h.in: Add HAVE_ZLIB_H define.
include/define.h: Update for the FLAG_CLIENT_ANIM values.
include/face.h: Remove MapLook structure - no longer used.
include/global.h: change extern type for pticks from long to uint32
include/map.h: Change MAP_LAYERS to 10.  Add definitions for what each
   map layer is.  Remove GET/SET_MAP_FACE macro - no longer used,
   GET/SET_MAP_FACE_OBJ replaces it.  Add GET_MAP_FACE_OBJS which
   returns pointer to all the object info for the space.  Remove
   faces from MapSpace structure.
include/newclient.h: Update with new defines used for map2 protocol
   command.
include/newserver.h:  Change type of faces in map_cell_struct to be
   uint16 to be consistent.  Change 'count' to 'darkness' to more
   accurately describe what it represents.  Add MAP2_COORD_OFFSET
   define.  Add Map2Cmd to MapMode enum.  Add map_scroll_x/y
   to socket structure so we send those as part of map2 command.
   Add tick field to socket structure to know if we should send
   tick data to the client.
server/login.c: Remove extern long pticks declaration - declared
   in global.h - don't need to declare it again locally.
socket/info.c: Rewrite magic map code to use GET_MAP_FACE_OBJ
   instead of GET_MAP_FACE macros.
socket/init.c: Initialize new fields in socket structure to 0.
socket/loop.c: If client wants tick data sent, send one each tick.
socket/request.c: Add setup responses for tick, map2 requests.  Remove some
   extra code in Map1a setup.  Send error message to client if not using
   at least Map1 protocol level.  Modify map_newmap_cmd() to clear
   scroll information when using Map2.  Remove original (map0) protocol
   logic.  Update map_clearcell() to clear all 10 layers.  Replace
   MAX_LAYERS with MAP_LAYERS.  Add add_head() to remove some of the
   complication from update_space().  Add code in draw_client_map1()
   to find which 3 layers to send to the client from the 10 we now have.
   Add map2_add_ob(), map2_delete_layer(), check_space_for_heads(),
   draw_client_map2() to handle map2 protocol.  Add send_tick() -
   sends tick to client, but also forces flush of data to reduce lag.
utils/config.guess.utils/config.sub,utils/ltmain.sh: rebuilt
MSW 2006-05-15

Fix server crash when sending addspell command(s).
---
socket/lowlevel.c: Do not abort if output buffer is completely filled. (Was
   off-by-one, so if addspell did fill the complete buffer, the server did
   detect an buffer-overflow error.)
socket/request.c: Update comments.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-05-13

Apply patch #1450408 (Improved hash table) by cf.schmorp.de development team.

include/map.h: Move path field to end of struct. Since this field was huge it
   pushed all other fields to large offsets in the struct. Moving it to the
   end of the struct mapdef should not break anything but will improve
   performance and reduce the server code by >3500 bytes.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-02-27

Minor bugfixes:
server/apply.c: Fix apply_transport ->contr checks to actually

lib/regions: add scorn and navar jails.
Brendan Lally 2006/02/08

Code that adds transports.  Transports are described more in detail in
docs/Developers/objects.
---
loader.l: Add new move type ('boat').  Update move_name field to be aware of
  this type.
common/object.c: Unrelated to transport, but more apparant with transports -
  fix bug with insert_ob_in_map() and multipart objects - we now only
  try to fix up map and coordinates if the provided coordinates are
  out of the map.  Before, function would always use the passed
  map for multipart objects, which is incorrect if we have already
  set valid coordinates.
doc/Developers/objects: Update notes for TRANSPORTS.  Update move
  information to include MOVE_BOAT.
include/define.h: Add type TRANSPORT.  Add MOVE_BOAT.
include/player.h: Add transport field to player structure.
include/sproto.h: rebuilt.
server/apply.c: Add code to handle applying of transports.  Update
  apply_below to apply transport if player is on one.
server/attack.c: Update hit_map() to look for transports, and hit any
  players with the damage.
server/c_object.c: Update put_object_in_sack() to also handle TRANSPORTS
  so that code can be re-used.
server/move.c:  Fix handling of multipart objects in move_object() -
  old code didn't work right with multipart objects moving along seams
  of tiled maps.  Add code to move_ob() to update player map position
  for all players in a moving transport.
server/player.c: Update move_player_attack() too check of player is
  in tranport, and use that for map and location information.  Update
  move_player() to handle speed related issues with transports.
server/time.c: Add code to credit time back to TRANSPORT objects since
  we remove time in move_player() for TRANSPORTS.
socket/item.c: Add add_object_to_socklist() so that same code isn't
  reproduced in 3 different places in the file.  Update draw_look()
  to handle transports - send transport object itself, then objects
  in transport.  Update esrv_send_inventory() and esrv_send_item()
  to use add_object_to_socklist().  Update esrv_get_ob_from_count() to look
  for objects in transport if player is in transport.
socket/loop.c: Remove checking of pl->map status, since draw_client_map()
  does that, and we need to handle if the player is in a transport.
socket/request.c: Handle map drawing if player is in a transport.
MSW 2006-02-06

movement type changes.  Add move_allow field to explicitly allow certain
movement types on spaces.  Add suppport for using string names instead
of numeric values to specify the MOVE_ values.  Add code so when saving
data out, use string names instead of numeric value.
---
common/loader.l: Remove save_double(), as it isn't used by any code.
   Add set_move() to set movement types from strings.  
   Add get_string_move_type, which takes integer movement type and
   returns a string.  Update load and save code to use these functions
   respectively.
common/map.c: Change blocked_link() so that we only examine all the objects
   on a space if there is something alive on the space or space is otherwise
   blocked.  There is no reason to examine all the objects on the space if
   the object in question can move onto it.
   Modify update_position() to use the move_allow field to clear bits
   in the move_block field.
common/object.c:  Add check in CAN_MERGE for move_allow.  Add check for
   move_allow in update_object to see if we should update the space or
   not.
doc/Developers/objects: Update Movement code section to note use of using
   strings to set movement types.  Add note about move_allow.  Section
   about Transports added, but code isn't there yet.
include/object.h: Add move_allow to object structure.
MSW 2006-02-04

   whether the pet is too far away.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2006-01-07

Change meaning of "items are on same map": for tiled maps now two objects are
also considered to be on the same map if they are on diagonally adjacent maps.
This solves the issue that a pet can be only one tile away from the owner but
still considered not to be on the same map.

Remove a strange feature of normalize_path(): it did convert the path
"<path1>//<path2>" into "/<path2>". Also add a stand-alone application for
regression testing this function, and fix a few issues with ".." in path name.
--
common/path.c: New file containing the modified implementation and the
   stand-alone application.
include/path.h: Prototypes for path.c.
server/main.c: Remove implementation; call renamed function.
common/Makefile.am, include/Makefile.am: Add new files.
common/Makefile.in, include/Makefile.in: Rebuilt.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-12-08

server/ban.c: General cleanup - whitespace changes, rename variable names.
   Should not affect function.
server/apply.c: In player_apply() do not consider DM PLAYERs to be DM-created
   items. This prevents the server from destroying the player object (and
   crashing shortly afterwards).
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-12-07

Apply slightly modified patch #1293744 (Inversed ban entries) by Thomas
Equeter.
--
server/ban.c: In checkbanned() recognize '~' prefix to allow entries. Also fix
   possible buffer overflow.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-12-07

Apply modified patch #1293774 (Kick banned hosts at once) by Thomas Equeter:
disconnect new connection for banned host right after connecting. Also add
support for user name in ban files.
--
lib/ban_file: Update comments and examples to new syntax.
server/ban.c: Allow a NULL user name to check for host name only.
server/c_misc.c: In receive_player_password() check for banned user name.
server/player.c: In add_player() remove check for banned host - this was
   already done if we reach this state.
socket/init.c, include/sockproto.h: Pass ip address as a string.
socket/loop.c: In doeric_server() check for banned host after a new connection
   was accepted.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-12-07

Apply patch #1371956 (code cleanup patch) by Stefan Huehner: fix old-style
function declarations and prototypes to proper Ansi C syntax. This patch
allows the compiler to check function arguments and also removes some warnings
when compiling with -Wstrict-prototypes.
--
All affected files: Convert "void foo()" into "void foo(void)".
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-12-06

Fix bug #1173563 (Creator created Bombs malfunction): Creators and Converters
now copy items from inventory. Fallback (for empty inventory) is the old
behavior to create the new item from other_arch. If the inventory contains more
than one item, a random one is picked.
--
common/loader.l: Mark inventory of CREATOR and CONVERTER as
   FLAG_CONTENT_ON_GEN.
common/loader.c: Rebuilt.
common/object.c: Update x/y/map for non-head parts to make inserting multipart
   objects via insert_ob_in_ob_at() work.
server/apply.c: In convert_item() consider inventory for item to create.
server/time.c: In move_creator() consider inventory for item to create. In
   process_object() ignore item flagged as FLAG_IS_A_TEMPLATE. (Otherwise
   bombs in inventories would explode prematurely.)
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-12-05

Fix bug #1372194 (stairways now block movement).
--
random_maps/exit.c: In unblock_exits() check correct field move_block to find
   blocking exits.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-12-03

server/apply.c: In move_apply() properly decrement recursion counter.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-12-02

server/spell_attack.c: Add some missing P_IS_ALIVE checks - these weren't
  needed in the past because living objects would block movement -
  with new movement code, isn't always the case.
server/time.c: Fix player movers so that if the victim doesn't have any
  movement type, we move it.
MSW 2005-11-30

common/time.c: In move_teleporter() and move_player_mover() do not affect DMs
   if FLAG_WIZPASS is set.
common/object.c: In check_move_on() do not affect DMs if FLAG_WIZPASS is set.
   This prevents DMs from triggering traps when walking over them.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-30

common/map.c: Replace code with OB_TYPE_MOVE_BLOCK - effectively same as what
  it was.
include/define.h: Update OB_TYPE_MOVE_BLOCK so that spaces that don't block
  any type of movement doesn't block objects that also don't have movement.
  This fixes cases of gates not pushing objects off them.
server/c_party.c: Remove double use of ->next pointer/loop in 
    confirm_party_password() - fixes crash and likely makes setting party
    password work more reliably.
MSW 2005-11-29

common/object.c: Fix wrong comparision operator in free_object2() to make
   monsters drop loot again.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-28

Basically added a parameter to 'skills' command to filter skills. And one char/const char* fix.
common/anim.c: use const char* for find_animation.
include/libproto.h: find_animation uses a const char*.
include/sproto.h: fix prototype.
server/c_wiz.c: send parameter to show_skills.
server/skill_util.c: add search parameter to show_skills command.
Ryo 2005-11-27

plugins/common/plugin_common.c: new wrappers for maps.
Ryo 2005-11-26

plugins/cfpython/Makefile.in: rebuilt.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-23

Plugins can now get archetypes. Added a check in cfapi_object_set_property to
 prevent changing archtypes.
Fixed some Python bugs related to map properties.
Added Crossfire.GetArchetypes and Crossfire.GetMaps to get all archetypes/maps.

server/shop.c: adjust minimum value that shop_specialisation_ratio can
return to 0.1. This should stop some prices being exceptionally high.
Brendan Lally 2005-11-19

Commit for new blocking code.  Not going to dictate all the changes -
but will outline the broad points.  Note also that the
doc/Developers/objects is updated and goes into more details also.
- check for P_WALL no longer used - instead, need to use GET_MAP_MOVE_BLCOK
  and check against movement type of objects.
- arch_blocked() changed to ob_blocked(), now takes object.  Needed because
  just looking at archetype move_ values is no longer sufficient.
- find_first_free_spot() changed to take object, since it just calls
  arch_blocked()
- FLAG_FLYING removed, now in move type.
- walk_on/walk_off/fly_on/fly_off removed - now based on move_on and
  move_off fields.
- Map space structure extended to hold the move_on/move_off, etc
  values so that we can shortcut some processing by not having to
  check every object on the space when something enters it if
  move_on isn't set.
- archetypes recollected - boulders needed move_walk to properly trigger
  buttons.
- Note that the new plugin code has to be fixed up for the new movement
  code.  Look for FIXME in plugins/cfpython/cfpython_object.c
MSW 2005-11-15

Apply patch 1352485 newpickup rings/amulets courtesy anonymous user.

server/plugins.c: Properly update client view after removing objects.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-10

server/plugins.c: Properly update client view after changing object names.
server/plugins.c: Return an empty string if an object has no message. This
   makes Object.Message() always return a string object, which removes the
   need for special case code to handle empty messages.
include/sproto.h, server/monster.c: Declare parameter of communicate() as
   "const".
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-09

Implement new functions for the Python plugin: Object.WeightLimit,
Object.InsertInto(Object), Object.NamePl. Change Object.Name to set both name
and name_pl. This should prevents scripts from failing to set name_pl.
--
plugins/cfanim/include/cfanim_proto.h, plugins/common/include/plugin_common.h:
   Add prototypes.
plugins/cfpython/cfpython_object.c: Add callback functions for new Python
   functions.

   callback functions. Add callback functions to Python object descriptors.
plugins/common/plugin_common.c: Add missing helper functions.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-09

server/shop.c: When we are counting unpaid items and their values, to check
if a player may leave a shop, make certain that we count all of them, and
don't stop when we have dropped into a container (such as a spellbook)
Brendan Lally 2005-11-09

plugins/cfpython/cfpython.c: Add missing 'PyType_Ready' calls for map and player,
 failure to do so crashes with Python objects destructors set to 0.
Ryo 2005-11-07

server/spell_effect.c: fix WoR not executing on cursed ground with WIZCAST set.
Ryo 2005-11-06

server/skills.c: In do_throw() abort processing if the thrown object was

server/build_map.c: test FLAG_IS_FLOOR too, type == FLOOR is not always enough.
Ryo 2005-11-05

server/shop.c: In value_limit() return the unmodified item price if not in a
   shop or not for a player.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-05

random_maps/treasure.c: Fix out-of-bounds array access if place_chest() cannot
   find a free spot to place a new chest.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-01

Fix bug #1082534 (monks with weapons): Now monks properly are denied from
using weapons. Only newly created monks are affected since it now relies on a
force named "no weapon force" in the player's inventory. The problem was that
become_follower() assumed it was the only means do allow/disallow weapon use.
--
server/gods.c: Do not let the god allow using weapons if a "no weapon force"
   object is present in the player's inventory.
lib/treasures: add force to monk's treasure list.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-01

Fix bug #815620 (CFPython.SetQuantity() doesn't update client): now notifies
   the client after changing nrof and/or weight.
--
server/plugins.c: Re-calculate player's weight and send item change
   notifications in cfapi_object_set_property().
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-01

server/weather: Declare many functions and variables as "static", add
   prototypes for affected functions. Declare some variables as "const".
include/sproto.h: Remove prototypes for now static functions.
include/tod.h: Add "const" to strings.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-11-01

Fix bug #1102975 (Bronze items not keeping their + in alchemy): the problem
was that a formula for full_helmet did exist but not for b_full_helmet. Since
both helmet's names are "full helmet", the recipe was selected even if using
the ingredient b_full_helmet. This fix adds new formulae for alternative
archetypes with the same name as the base object, and makes the server code
select the matching formula from multiple arch names in the "arch" field.
--
common/readable.c: Use new fields to build messages.
common/recipe.c: Make alchemy work for recipes with multiple base archetypes.
include/{libproto.h,sproto.h}: Update prototype.
include/recipe.h: Split string field arch_name into string list fields
   arch_name and arch_names.
lib/formulae: Add archetype names to formulae for all items with same name as
   the base object. Also fix a few name mismatches that prevent any object
   from matching, and change transmution formulae to normal formulae where
   base name does not match archetype name.
server/alchemy.c: Disable debugging code. Make alchemy work for recipes with
   multiple base archetypes.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-10-31

server/c_wiz.c: Don't crash on "create" a living thing that has some part
 out of the map. Forbid removing a 'PLAYER' object.
Ryo 2005-10-31

random_maps/style.c: Pass correct sorting function to qsort(): the sorted
   array contains pointers to strings, not strings.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-10-29

Fix bug #1236244 (Exp from scrolls): reading a scroll of charm monsters or
meteor swarm now gives exp for use magic item, not summoning or pyromancy.
--
server/spell_attack.c: In mood_change() use skill from scroll, not from spell.
   In move_swarm_spell() use the spell "owner" as the object casting the
   spell.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-10-29

include/config.h: DEBUG just been defined, no need to define it again.
include/win32.h: typedef for socklen_t.
random_maps/random_map.c: generate_random_map can use a const char*.

server/plugins.c: EVENT_CRASH doesn't really need a parameter, especially if
 not initialized :)
Ryo 2005-10-29


Prevent problems (crashes) for large item piles. Now limit nrof to less than
2^31.
--
common/object.c: In CAN_MERGE() pretend that the objects are not mergeable if
   the nrof sum would overflow.
common/porting.c: Fix buffer overflow for large numbers in ltostr10(). Also
   make n=1L<<31 work correctly.
plugins/cfpython/cfpython_object.c: In Object_SetQuantity() raise an exception
   for negative nrof values.
plugins/common/plugin_common.c: Reject negative nrof values in
   cf_object_set_nrof().
plugins/cfanim/include/cfanim_proto.h, plugins/common/include/plugin_common.h:
   Update prototype.
server/plugins.c: Treat negative nrof as nrof=0 when setting
   CFAPI_OBJECT_PROP_NROF property.
server/time.c: In move_duplicator() limit nrof of created items.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-10-29

Fix compiler warnings. Most changes do not change the program (remove unused
variables, convert "if(x = y)" into "x = y; if(x)"); a few actually fix
(possible) problems (fix uninitialized variables, fix printf format
specifiers, fix mismatches between signed and unsigned variables, add missing
return and default statements).

The archetypes now contain more than MAXFACENUM (5000) faces. The following
changes remove the fixed limit of the number of faces. The server now
allocates enough memory to handle all defined faces.

   NewSocket.faces_sent from array into pointer.
socket/{init.c, loop.c}: Allocate/initialize NewSocket.faces_sent.
socket/request.c: Remove safeguard/error message since it depends on
   MAXFACENUM.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-10-24

Code improvements:
common/image.c: Declare some variables and functions as static or const; add
   safeguards while loading config files; remove support for numeric face
   names (no active archetype or map does use it); in free_all_images()
   deallocate memory allocated for smoothing.
crossedit/xutil.c: Remove assignment to nrofpixmaps since ReadBmapNames()
   already sets this variable.
include/{global.h, libproto.h, loader.h}: Remove now static variables and

Fix several bugs in patch #1194964, including one that caused segfaults
one that corrupted the party list, and one that broke party password recognition
remove partyid from the party struct - use party pointers instead
remove functions find_party() and find_party_struct() - no longer needed or used.
make form_party a local function - it is only used by the party form command, 
and can't easy be used safely elsewhere.

Make untriggered TIMED_GATEs work again.
server/apply.c: Clear object speed only for connected objects.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-09-13

This change is mostly cosmetic and a preparation for the new movement
type code.  Basically, it just changes the old object movement_type
field to attack_movement.  This makes sense because that is what that
field is called in saved and loaded objects/archetypes, and thus
frees up that name for the new movement code.
--
common/button.c: field name change
common/loader.{cl}: field name change

Fix bug #1059537 (Chainmail mutations):
common/loader.l: Remove code that "fixes" broken item names by removing a
   leading material name. This effectively renames "mithril chainmails" into
   "chainmails".
common/loader.c: Rebuilt.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-08-29

Fix player weapon speed/speed.  There are a few bugs this fixes:
1) when player hit something, a has_hit field was set to true, to denote
   they hit something and to use weapon speed. However, this was only
   cleared when player issued a command.  Thus, if you are running 
   and hit something, you'd continue at weapon_speed pace until you
   needed to change direction.
2) Because has_hit was used, this basically put in a 1 tick lag - you'd hit
   something, but not until objects were processed and speed given would
   you get your extra speed.  Likewise, after you killed something, you'd
   get your burst of speed for the next tick also.
--
server/main.c: Clear has_hit, change function to only do bounds checking,
   not actually do weapon_speed adjustments.
server/player.c:  Give player speed boost when they hit something.

   msg header to already existing maps.
crossedit/crossedit.c: Call init_regions() at program initialization.

socket/init.c: Make setsockopt(REUSEADDR) work if using gcc in Ansi C mode on
   Linux.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-08-28

common/map.c: Change default values for reset_timeout, enter_x, and enter_y
   map headers to zero. In set_map_reset_time() use MAP_DEFAULTRESET if
   reset_timeout is zero. This change prevents crossedit from adding these
   headers by just loading and saving a map.

   large objects players can pick up.  Also fix up some of the formatting/
   indenting in this file.

String fields in structures using add_string are now const char*. Functions in

Those commits remove the dependency on the plugin towards the library. All functions
 used from the plugin are hooked, instead of being called directly. This fixes bugs
 under Windows, and simplifies compilation. Also, many new callbacks were defined.
Affected files:
 include/plugin.h plugproto.h sproto.h
 plugin/plugin_python.c
 server/plugins.c
Note that at some point some functions could be moved out of plugin_python and put in
 plugin_general to be shared between different plugins.
Ryo 2005-07-15

Those commits remove the whole "glue/callback" logic. Instead functions are just
defined as external, and should be implemented (even as dummy) by all programs.
Affected files:
 common/arch.c button.c glue.c init.c item.c living.c logger.c los.c map.c object.c
  time.c treasure.c
 crossedit/stubs.c: new file with dummy functions.
 crossedit/Makefile.[in|am]: add this new file.
 include/funcpoint.h libproto.h sproto.h
 random_maps/standalone.c: add dummy functions for those externals.
 server/init.c: remove obsolete setup_library()

Added a wrapper function for check_trigger from plugins.
 include/plugin.h: new function
 server/plugins.c: wrapper for check_trigger.

Ryo 2005-07-15

plugin/plugin_python.c: (add|free)_string should *not* be called directly under Win32.
 Therefore let's use the hooks. Also, when removing an object, better check it's not the
 current object (CFPython.RemoveObject(CFPython.WhoAmI()) anyone?).
Ryo 2005-07-15

server/init.c: Fix error message.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-07-10

configure.ac, configure, aclocal.m4, Makefile.in: Add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE
   macro to configure.ac - this should hopefully supress auto regeneration of
   makefiles.in
MSW 2005-07-08

Add a --with-python option to configure.  Also, update the python
detection script to check for 2.5 (not out yet, but might as well be prepared.)

MSW 2005-07-08

lib/settings: Turn of fastclock as default option.
socket/loop.c: Change behaviour of metaserver/flushmaps/watchdog
   calls if fastclock is set - don't do those any faster than normal.
MSW 2005-06-22

Server can now be used as a Windows server, with command-line options
 -regsrv (register server and exit), -unregsrv (unregister server and exit)
 and -srv (should not be used directly, for the service control manager call).
server/init.c: add command-line options.

 * changing configure to detect the absence of 'alphasort' prototype
 * converted some '//' comment to /**/ one
 * reran automake1.8/autoconf2.50/autheader2.50
Note even it it compiles with -ansi -pedantic, it still need cleanup to
get 64 bits experience code working!

include/libproto.h, include/sproto.h: Rebuilt as there were some improperly
   matching prototypes.
random_maps/rogue_layout.c: Replace sqrt with isqrt calls.
server/c_misc.c: Make name_cmp() a static declaration so it won't be put
   in the sproto.h file.
server/init.c: Remove /* within comment string.
server/monster.c: Change sqrt to isqrt
MSW 2005-04-16

server/weather.c: weathermap_to_worldmap_corner now uses const char* as
    return type.
Ryo 2005-04-14

Random map code improvements - add support for subdirectories in the
style maps for random maps.  Add difficulty_increase parameter for random
maps to control how fast they get harder.
doc/Developers/random-maps: Add notes about difficulty_increase parameter.
random_maps/Makefile.am: Update proto directive to use cproto, not cextract.
random_maps/random_map.c: Update to use difficulty_increase when figuring
   difficulty of maps.  Add code to save it in list of parameters.
random_maps/random_map.h: Add difficulty_increase field to structure.
random_maps/reader.l, reader.c: Add code to find difficulty_increase parameter.
random_maps/rproto.h: rebuilt.
random_maps/special.c: Pass in difficulty increase to
   write_parameters_to_string()
random_maps/style.c: Remove old scandir - replaced by our own load_dir() -
   necessary because we need to check type of files, which scandir doesn't
   easily let us do.  Since it is now our own routine, just return
   array of file names instead of dirent structures.
MSW 2005-04-13

utils/Makefile.am: Add cfmeta-rrd to list of files to add to distributions
utils/cfmeta-rrd: Example of sample script that takes data and stores it into
   rrd file and draws graphs (new file).
utils/metaserver.pl.in: Add recording of useful stats to external file so they
   can be processed by other external scripts.
MSW 2005-04-13

server/shop.c: Pass in player object to pay_from_container() - code was
  trying to deref pouch->contr which was null.  Only occurs when player
  has 2 different money objects of the same type, but 2 crashes observed
  on metalforge.
MSW 2005-04-13

socket/image.c: Change esrv_send_face to check for <=0 instead of <0 on face
  number.

server/c_misc.c: move local function outside the function.
server/c_wiz.c: remove sleep( 1 ) that would cause whole server to sleep one
    sec.
Ryo 2005-03-23

common/living.c: Allow luck to drop back to zero. Limit bad luck object to
   +/-100 to prevent overflows.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-03-22

common/living.c: When randomly adjusting luck, change both op->stats.luck and
   the applied bad_luck object.
server/attack.c: Do not decrease luck if a player kills himself with a spell
   or pet.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-03-20

server/c_wiz.c: change command_free() and command_remove() to always
  process the head of the object - doing this operations on the non head
  will typically always cause problems.
MSW 2005-03-19

This change makes it so that the smoothing information is pushed to the client
(if the client is using smoothing) instead of a process were we tell the
client the smoothlevel and the client then has to request the face info for
smoothing.  If we know the client wants the info, much easier to push it to
the client.  This simplifies the client code (doesn't have to keep track
of what is requests).  It also fixes the 'problem' that when you join the
game, you get a few frames with no smoothing and then the smoothing shows
up, which seems a bit odd.  My testing shows that old clients that want
smoothing use this new logic withouth any problems.
--
common/image.c: add smooth_face default so that we don't have to look it
  up everytime.
include/define.h: Add SMOOTH_FACE_NAME used by image.c
include/global.h: Add smooth_face extern declaration.
include/newserver.h: Update comment on what faces_sent is used for,
   add NS_FACESENT_* values which determines what info for the face was
   sent.
socket/image.c, socket/init.c, socket/item.c: Update faces_sent checks/set 
    to check against NS_FACESENT bitmask.
socket/request.c: Update faces_sent as mentioned above.  And SendSmooth(),
   rewrite AskSmooth() to use SendSmooth().  Modify update_smooth()
   to send smoothing information to the client.
MSW 2005-03-19

common/map.c: Clean up if statement ins blocked_link() which caused warning
   messages - broke it apart to make it a little clear.  Add check for
   premature end of map header - make code more resilent in case of truncated
   saved maps.  Fix saving of region name in new_save_map() - saving the
   pointer to the region isn't what the loader is expecting, and is highly
   non portable even if it was.
MSW 2005-03-18

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 1.7.0:

configure, configure.ac, include/autoconf.h.in:  Update for
   version 1.7.0.  Add check for libz - needed by libpng (at least on my
   system), which is needed for the editor.
MSW 2005-01-23

common/object.c: Change CAN_MERGE() from an inline function, since
   it calls itself and inline functions are not supposed to do that.
   Update type check in insert_ob_in_map() to check against defined
   type (EXIT) instead of hardcoded integer value (66).
crossedit/xutil.c:  Update to just include Defines.h, which then includes
   all the other necessary files, including global.h.
include/global.h: Add #ifdef checks for the UINT*_MAX types, as some
   systems already define these values, which results in a redefinition
   error.  Also fix up // style comment.
include/shstr.h: Include proper cast in TOPBIT definition.
server/main.c: Don't display 'xyz left the game' messages if the player
   is only at the get name or get password prompt.  Prevents possible
   spoofing of that message.
server/player.c: Clean up formatting of check_pick() function.  If player
   is using newpickup to pick up booze, also pick up poison unless
   they know it is cursed.
socket/request.c: AskSmooth() - change buffer type to uint8 so that
   it matches what the SockList structure wants.
utils/scores.pl.in: Use skill_praying to find players god, and not the
   deprecated experience_wis object.
MSW 2005-01-23

aclocal.m4, configure: Add check for python 2.4.
common/re-cmp.c: Fix improper comparison *(str+1) instead of str+1
server/login.c: don't allow null names.
server/main.c: Disable logging of removed objects - filling up log
   files on archmage of all the errors.
server/player.c: Fix improper initialization of attacktype in
   for loop.  Give players max grace, sp when they die - also, if they
   are near starvation, give them a bunch of food.
server/spell_effect.c: Put cap on duration of godly retribution - it
   can otherwise last so long that if a player is killed by it at
   their savebed location, spell could still go on after players
   temporary immunity ends.  Retribution as increases in damage,
   so no need to really increase damage and duration to really high
   amounts.
server/spell_util.c: In fire_arch_from_position(), and check that
   player isn't casting spell on top of wall - fixes for many
   spells, including ball lightning.
server/time.c: Change comparsion on return of get_map_flags() from
   == P_OUT_OF_MAP to & P_OUT_OF_MAP - keeps syntax consistent.
MSW 2005-01-11

plugin/plugin_python.c, plugin_animator/plugin_animator.c,
plugin_animator/plugin_animator.c: Use script return value set by
   CFPython.SetReturnValue(): access to stack was off by one. Do not return a
   pointer to a local variable on the stack.
plugin/plugin_python.c, plugin_animator/plugin_animator.c: Handle all defined
   events.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-01-10

server/spell_attack.c: apply patch #1096921 courtesy Salathar.
   Charmed monsters now lose the 'generator' flag, to prevent
   things like mice outbreak in bigworld maps.
Ryo 2005-01-07

plugin/plugin_pyhton.c, plugin/include/plugin_python.h: Remove obsolete
   functions: SetGender, SetRank, SetAlignment, SetGuildForce, GetGuildForce,
   CreatePlayerForce, CreatePlayerInfo, GetPlayerInfo, GetNextPlayerInfo,
   SetPreviousObject, SetNextObject.
plugin/plugin_python.c, plugin/include/plugin_python.h: Add missing attack type
   wrapper functions, function CFPython.SetDamned(), wrapper functions for
   missing cost flags, and wrapper functions for event types.
plugin/plugin_python.c: Add an optional parameter to CFPython.SetName() to
   specify name_pl as well. Always set name_pl.
plugin/plugin_python.c: Fix a buffer overflow in CFPython.RegisterCommand():
   allocated memory was not sufficient to hold the trailing '\0'.
plugin/plugin_python.c: Use #define constants.
plugin/include/plugin_python.h, plugin/plugin_python.c,
plugin_animator/plugin_animator.c, server/plugins.c: General cleanup - merge
   duplicate code, remove debugging code, rename variables, rename C function
   names to match the Python function name, use hook functions where
   appropriate.
include/sproto.h, plugin/plugin_python.c, server/plugins.c, server/shop.c:
   Use uint64 type for variables holding money. Use Python long integers to
   pass these variables to/from the Python plugin.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-01-07

plugin/plugin_python.c: Check values passed in from the Python code; generate
   proper Python exceptions for invalid values.
plugin/plugin_python.c, plugin_animator/plugin_animator.c: Make sure all
   fields on the stack are initialized. Prevent stack overflow: check was one
   off, causing a buffer overflow. Decrement stack pointer in error case.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2005-01-06.

common/regexp.c: Fixed couple flaws in regexp handling.  First, there was an
   off by one error in the handling of matches (if the match was for example
   eureca, player could just say eurec, and it would treat that as a valid
   match).  Second case was that the regular expression logic would not
   try comparing the rest of the passed in string after a partial match -
   In the eureca case above, if the passed in string was 'where is eureca',
   after matching the first e (in where), it then fails to match the
   next letter and would give up.  It now tries comparing the rest of
   the passed in string with the regex (so after that failure, it 
   will try to match 're is eureca'.
server/apply.c: Add missing 'return 0' to shop_mat code that is needed
   to prevent unpaid objects from teleporting out of the shop.  Also
   extend code so that non living objects can't use shop mats.
server/player.c: Insert force into the player when they die making them
   immune to any spells on the space they reappear on - this prevents
   multiple deaths if there is large spell effect going on in the
   savebed location.  Duration of force should be long enough for most
   spells to run their course, but no so long that the player can use
   it for much of an advantage (plus, killing yourself to get such
   an advantage seems odd, and the force only makes the player immune
   to the attacktypes currently on the space)
server/spell_effect.c: Fix spell casting walls (lighting wall,
   firewall, etc) in that the spell object they cast was not being
   inserted, resulting in the walls not doing anything.
MSW 2004-12-28

Applied patch (bug misc/zoo2) by Lalo
server/time.c: creators can now create multi part objects.
Applied patch 1086102 by Salathar:
server/attack.c:  If player kills another player, add (pk) to the death
   message.
Applied patch 1086103 by Salathar:
server/move.c: If player pushes another player, send message to both players
  that pushed happened.  Previously, when pushing another player, the pusher
  wouldn't get any notice.

Applied patch 1001079 - make alchemy books say what skill & equipment
  is needed - by Kevin Rudat.
common/readable.c: Update code that generates book title, contents
   to denote what skill and equipment is needed.
random_maps/{random_map.c, reader.l, reader.c}, server/main.c:
   Remove generate_treasure_now as an option
   for random maps - none are using delayed treasure, and IMO, if someone
   did, it would horribly break things, so it should never be used - given
   that, no reason to leave the code there.
server/main.c: Add additional debugging for process events on removed
   objects - trying to track down occasional disease crash.
server/time.c: Fix crash in move_player_mover() - it was never map tile
   aware, but even more so, appears to have always been broken if the
   player move tried to push the player off the edge of a map.  Check
   for out of map condition, as well as make it map tile aware.
MSW 2004-12-28

Applied patches #1086095 and 1088385 courtesy Salathar:
 common/map.c: hidden DM is non blocking
 server/c_chat: can't do emotions towards hidden DMs. Player's emotions
   always displayed in split window.
 server/c_wiz.c: add an extra player leave message when DM hides
 server/main.c: don't display leave messages for hidden DM when connection timeout
server/c_party.c: party password max length is 7, due to buffer size.
   (i think it was a patch from Casper?)
Ryo 2004-12-25

server/c_wiz.c: Remove item when 'free' by DM if not removed, avoiding crash.
Ryo 2004-12-22

server/c_party.c: actually warn party members of password change. Notify when
   someone joins party.
Ryo 2004-10-21

plugin/plugin_python.c, plugin/include/plugin_python.h, server/plugins.c:
   Fix comments, change whitespace.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-10-19

Fix some bugs I introduced in my last commit.
common/map.c: Add back in call to sum_weight that got removed when removing
   the object checking code.
common/treasure.c: Have fix_generated_item() blank out the randomitems
   field after it has created treasure.
server/apply.c: Only clear randomitems after create_treasure() - don't
   presume it should get blanked out for other reasons - with change
   to treasure.c above, this should be more reliable and fix starting
   skill issue, as randomitems was getting blanked out for CLASS object.
server/main.c: Change processing of players a little - found crash where
   autosave was called for a removed player (map had got swapped out) -
   don't do autosave logic if player is removed.  Move the autosave code
   to after the players action, so that can just have a single check of
   removed status.
MSW 2004-10-17

include/sproto.h, server/egoitem.c: Change create_artifact() to return whether
   the artifact was created.
server/plugins.c: Change CFWCreateArtifact()/HOOK_CREATEARTIFACT to return
   whether the artifact was created.
plugin/plugin_python.c: Define new function create_object() to create
   objects. Use this function to fix CFPython.CreateObjectInside() and
   CFPython.CreateObject(): creation of artifacts does work now.
plugin/plugin_python.c: Fix CFPython.GetNextPlayerInfo() to work with long
   force names. Remove duplicate variable initialization.
server/plugins.c: Remove the use of malloc() in initOnePlugin().
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-10-18

plugin/plugin_python.c, plugin_animator/animator_box.c,
plugin_animator/plugin_animator.c, plugin_logger/arena.c,
plugin_logger/plugin_logger.c: Use HOOK_FREEMEMORY to free memory allocated
   by HOOK-functions. Fix memory leaks.
plugin/plugin_python.c, server/plugin.c, plugin_animator/animator_box.c: Fix
   some more mismatches between plugin interface and implementation.
   CFPython.Get/SetSkillExperience() use 64-bit exp values now.
   CFPython.CastAbility() works again.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-10-16

plugin/plugin_python.c, server/plugin.c: Fix type mismatches between plugin
   interface and implementation.
plugin/plugin_python.c, server/plugin.c: Add/remove "static" to/from some
   variables. Fixes a memory leak in CFPython.SaveObject().
plugin/plugin_python.c: Fix reference counting for Python objects.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-10-15

common/living.c: Fix exp functions to use the player objects expmul
   value when determining level gains, and not the skills.  Also,
   fix bug where players last hp/sp/grace gain I think was being
   re-rolled when player gained level in skill.
common/loader.l, loader.c: Add better recording of non existant objects
  (no archetype for them) in maps.  Also, handle such objects in
   players inventories properly (which is to just discard them)
common/map.c: Add better logging about discarded archetypes.  Since the
   loader now deals with objects without archs in inventories, that
   code doesn't need to be in the server.
common/object.c: copy_object() was not properly nulling out the
   next field in the event object, pointer to event list was also 
   incorrect, causing events to not be copied properly.
doc/spoiler-html/spoiler.html: Rebuilt.
server/apply.c: Apply patch by MT that fixes problem of entire inventory
   not being copied properly.  Fix problem that objects in creatures
   were not having any sub treasure created (eg, put a pyro_book in 
   a monster on the map, and the pyro_book wouldn't have a spell in
   it) - now we make sure we process inventory objects as well as map
   objects, creating treasure as needed.
server/monster.c: Reverse order of cast_spell() and drain_rod() in
   monster_use_range() - drain_rod() should go first, because
   case_spell() can in rare cases destroy the rod.
MSW 2004-10-14

server/c_misc.c: Add natural skin resistances to 'statistics' output for
  dragon players.
Ryo 2004-10-10

common/readable.c: Apply patch by Kevin Rudat to add some alchemy book names.
common/readable.c: Apply patch by Kevin Rudat to fix buffer overrun while
  generating book titles.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-10-09

include/sproto.h: Add function prototype.
server/c_wiz.c: Add 'command_stack_clear' to clear DM item stack.
server/commands.c: Link function to function array.
Ryo 2004-09-26

server/player.c: Allow to 'reply' to players that logged out but did not yet
   drop the connection. Now reply works like other communication commands.
common/utils.c: Fix random_roll() and die_roll() to not return out of range
  values.
include/define.h: Add parentheses around arguments of FABS macro.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-09-19

server/rune.c: Prevent creation of level 0 runes. Re-enable runes to cast
   multiple spells.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-09-14

include/config.h: fix Win32 log path so there actually is a log.
plugin/plugin_python.c: uint doesn't exist under Win32, use uint32 instead.

server/attack.c: Pass in skill (string) to change_exp instead of skop->skill -
   skop can be null, resulting in a crash here.  In addition, other calls
   to change_exp in this function use the skill string, so it is good to
   be consistent.
MSW 2004-09-09

server/c_wiz.c: Don't forget to skip blanks after reading item number or stack
   position. Works better for commands like patch :)
Ryo 2004-09-06

common/object.c: Fix insert_ob_in_map so right coordinates and map
   value are used on GET_MAP_OB call - was using values before changes
   for tiling were applied.
MSW 2004-09-02

server/player.c: allow to 'talk' to players with ambiguous names: use a
   perfect match even if other partial matches exist.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-08-30

server/shop.c
   add new flags F_IDENTIFIED and F_NOT_CURSED to query_cost() to pretend
   the item to be identified/not cursed or damned.
server/alchemy.c
   fix possible abuse of shadow alchemy: do not allow the generated items
   to be more valuable than the ingredients when using alternate recipes.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-08-24

common/map.c: Add extra check to make sure variable is set before calling
   strcmp - this can happen if the map file that is being loaded is
   0 bytes - without this, the server would crash.
MSW 2004-08-23


server/disease.c: fix crash when casting diseases on tiled maps.
server/move.c: fix problem with multi-tile monsters and pass thru walls.
server/spell_effect.c: fix magic walls sometimes appearing in wrong place.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-08-20

common/loader.l, loader.c: in check_loaded_object() - don't give spell
   objects inventory if we are in the arch_init phase.  When loading objects
   in common loader routine, if object doesn't have arch, set the object
   name to the arch name so that it is more meaningful than 'singularity'.
common/map.c: If object has inventory, check to make sure the inventory
   objects have an archetype set - if not, remove and free the object -
   objects without archetypes causes crashes. 
MSW 2004-08-17

server/apply.c: fix_auto_apply() - add some debugging statements, as I've
   seen crashes caused by monsters with scrolls with no spells - need to
   figure out how those are showing up.
server/c_wiz.c: command_kick() - fix occasional crashes when player isn't
  on any map when kicked.  command_create() largely rewritten so it doesn't
  crash the server on any malformed values passed in, add some more features
  so it should be easier to create objects.
MSW 2004-08-16

server/apply.c: better to not create a treasure for spellbooks that already have
    something in inventory. Else you get 2 spells in the book, which then
    mutates when loading (first spell is the book's spell, and order changes every
    load/save...)
Ryo 2004-08-16

Those changes mostly add an item stack for DMs. It makes it easier to dump & patch &
manipulate items without having to copy numbers all the time.
Basically, you can use '$x', meaning item at position x on stack. Or even
omit argument, defaulting to stack top.
When using an object number, it gets stacked automatically (up to 50 items).
Also add a 'diff' command, letting the DM see the result of 'get_ob_diff' on items,
to spot differences easily.

common/player.c: free item stack when freeing player structure.
include/player.h: add item stack to player structure.
include/sproto.h: new functions for stack.
include/win32.h: missed commit for 1.6.1 version.
server/c_misc.c: push item dumped with 'deumpbelow' on dm stack.
server/c_wiz.c: add stack functions. Use'em on patch, create, remove, free, and such.
    Add 'diff' command.
server/commands.c: add new stack & diff commands.
Ryo 2004-08-15

server/spell_attack.c: fix mood_change when spell has no attacktype.
    In this case, do a specific saving throw, to ensure a level 1 player
    can't charm a level 125 monster.

    pythonplug now looks for event scripts in maps/python/events.
TM 2004-08-02

server/skills.c: xp for writing is now multiplied by skill level, to
   make it possible to level.
Ryo 2004-07-17

common/loader.c: add #ifndef for non-existant Win32 header
include/win32.h: #define vsnprintf _vsnprintf to fix linking issue

server/skill_util.c: Fix skills command so that it properly displays
   percentage of permanent exp.
server/time.c: Modify move_arrow() so that it removes thrown objects
   with no inventory.
MSW 2004-06-22

socket/info.c: Replace sprintf() calls with snprintf() - got metalforge
   crash with apparent buffer overun - going to snprintf should prevent
   the problem in the future.
MSW 2004-06-21

server/c_wiz.c: for command_create() - check to see if 'of' parameter
   is a spell archetype name, and do the right thing if it is.  This
   allows things like 'create rod_heavy of spell_large_lightning'.
   Note that the command_create is still a seriously broken function
   in many regards.
server/rune.c: Fix write_rune() when trying to find the spell in encase
   in the rune - assignment was incorrect, so it always took the last
   matching spell in the players inventory, not the best matching spell.
server/spell_util.c: Change the call to prayer_failure() so that its
   potency is based on how badly short the player is short of grace.  Eg,
   if only 1 point short, potency of 1.  This changes from before where
   the potency was always the difference in mana.
MSW 2004-06-17

server/attack.c: Fix hit_with_arrow() so that it uses the proper map
   when inserting the arrow.
server/c_wiz.c: Add note about brokeness of command_create()
server/spell_effect.c: execute_word_of_recall() - don't attempt recall
   if player isn't on any map.

Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-06-13

server/spell_attack.c: cast_destruction() - have it change the skill
   for the caster so that exp is properly awarded.
common/object.c: insert_map_in_ob() - remove CAN_MERGE checks after the
    map translation - otherwise, we can have bogus coordinates
    that are used for GET_MAP_OB.
random_maps/style.c: pick_random_object() - have it return null object
    (and probably crash) instead of getting into an infinite loop.
server/c_wiz.c: command_kick() - check FLAG_FREED of player.  Remove all
    the broken skill/exp object granting code in command_possess() - this
    is probably still a broken function.
common/item.c: describe_monster() - if the creature/player is stealthy,
    mention it when the object is described.
common/loader.l, loader.c: Fix passed in size to get_ob_diff() - was one
    to long, causing string corruption.
server/spell_attack.c: mood_change() - fix get_map_ob call - wasn't using
    correct coordinate variables, resulting in crash.
MSW 2004-06-10

server/c_party.c: gsay improvements, courtesy Katia.
Ryo 2004-06-09

server/commands.c: Disable 'possess', that crashes server.
server/monster.c: Make monsters use wands/horns/... again. Also make'em
   ignore DMs all the time (even when not invisible).
server/skill_util.c: Fix the change_skill when called for monsters.
Ryo 2004-06-06

server/c_misc.c: Add sum_weight() call to fix_me command so that players
  weight is properly recalculated.
server/skills.c: Fix up attempt_steal() so that it doesn't improperly
  remove object from target when person doing the stealing can't pick
  it up.
server/spell_attack.c: Set maxhp properly, so multipled fireballs, etc
  can be going off at the same time.
server/spell_effect.c: Fix up cast_create_missile() so more esoteric
  missiles can be created.
MSW 2004-05-31

include/sproto.h: new 'dmhide' command.
server/commands.c: new 'dmhide' command.
server/c_wiz.c: added 'dmhide' command. Player becomes DM, and 'hide's immediately. Others
   only see him/her leave the game, they don't know s/he's DM.
Ryo 2004-05-24

include/book.h: Increase the size of BOOK_BUF, so inscribed books can hold
  more informatin.
lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in: Add the 'rename' to the list of help
   files.
lib/archetypes: update the glyph/rune spells to have proper face.
lib/bmaps, lib/crossfire.* - add glyph.111 image.
server/gods.c: Modify tailor_god_spell() to look harder to find a god -
  necessary for glyph spells.
server/spell_attack.c: Give players 50% of exp for monsters they charm.
MSW 2004-05-19

common/object.c: Correct get_search_arr() to return a proper permutation.

server/main.c: Have process_events display information from dumped object.
   also, more refinement on checking of object status.
MSW 2004-05-16

server/build_map.c: change 'player' variable to 'pl', since a player
    structure already exists. Also fix disappearing pedestals on non-unique
    maps (put'em over floor, they are visible but hey, can't have everything :p)
server/c_wiz.c: fix learn_spell.
Ryo 2004-05-16

server/main.c: freeing removed objects appeared to have more of a
  consequence than expected - only remove the object if it was on a map
  (op->map).  It turns out that the artifact code uses objects that
  are removed to store what the new object is.
server/spell_effect.c: Fix cast_create_food() to call 
    find_archetype_by_object_name() instead of find_archetype().  In this
    way, players can use invoke without having to know the archetype name.
server/c_wiz.c: Modify command_banish() to record dm name, player name,
   and date of command.
server/acinclude.m4: Patch by acinclude.m4 to add python 2.3 support.
  Rebuilt files (Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure, configure.in).  add
  config.guess, config.sub since automake now includes them in the Makefile.in
  file.
MSW 2004-05-15


Added a new item type: ground positioning system (GPS).
This lets a player know his/her location in the world.
Only works in 'world_xxx_xxx' maps.

include/define.h: add new item type, 'GPS' (162).
include/sproto.h: add new function, 'apply_positioning_system'.
server/apply.c: handle new item type.
Ryo 2004-05-15

server/spell_util.c: SP_level_spellpoint_cost() - never have a spell
  cost 0 spellpoints due to attunement or other bonuses - spell always
  cost at least 1 sp/grace.
server/main.c: Fix process_events() so it doesn't purge removed players
  from the list - players get in the removed state at play again
  prompt.
server/apply.c: Fix fix_auto_apply() so we don't generate additional
  spells for spellcasting objects that already have them (regression
  from fix from 5/11 below)
MSW 2004-05-13

server/pets.c: Fix summon golem, summon pet monsters so that the summoned
   monsters are not worth any exp.  Fixes bugs were players could
   summon monsters and then kill them.
server/skills.c: Fix do_skill_detect_curse() and do_skill_detect_magic()
   so that they don't process objects the player is incapable of picking
   up (eg, floors).  Fixes experience exploit.
server/apply.c: modify fix_auto_apply() so that it properly generates
   items for creatures that start with objects in their inventory.
MSW 2004-05-11

server/spell_util.c: Fix cast_spell() so that failed spells (due to
  encumberance or other penalties) still cost some random number of grace/
  mana points.
MSW 2004-05-10

common/treasure.c: Change the loading of the artifacts file to actually
  calloc() the object - reset_object() doesn't clear all the values,
  like active_next, active_prev, so better to just do it there.
server/main.c: Add code in process_events() that checks for removed objects -
   have seen occasional crashes caused by them.
MSW 2004-05-08

Armor enchantment now uses setting values.
common/init.c: new values to init in settings.
include/global.h: new setting values.

include/config.h: change default logfile path to previous value in init.c.
server/c_wiz.c: Fix 'nodm' displaying incorrect messages, and forgetting to
   update player count on map.

server/apply.c: Fix apply_special() to properly deal with LAMP objects - it
   wasn't dealing properly with the split off lamp compared to the one it
   was supposed to deal with - was crashing server.
MSW 2004-05-04

common/item.c: describe_monster() - print luck when describing players (fixex
   perceive self not showing luck)
server/attack.c: kill_object() - don't give player exp if he kills himself -
   compare owner against what was killed, not the hitter.
server/pets.c: summon_object() - move breaking out for last treasurelist
   after we set the last valid treasurelist - otherwise, the list entry for
   the treasurelist was never used.  Change summoned creatures so that
   the items they have are god given, and thus disappear when they
   are killed - prevents players from summoning and then looting their pets.
server/spell_attack.c: explode_bullet() - Get owner of the spell so that we
   can properly tailor the explosion portion of the spell for the god
   of the worshipper.

Changes for 1.6.0:

configure, Makefiles: Rebuilt for 1.6.0 release
doc/*/Makefile.am: Modified to use one makeps.pl utility in scripts directory.
doc/scripts/makeps.pl: Make this the definitive copy - fix problem with it 
   trying to combine big images when it doesn't need to.  Remove other copies.
doc/playbook/chap1.tex, doc/playbook/chap5.tex: Fix some obvious errors,
   but overall, the playbook is still quite out of date.
doc/playbook/treas2-extract: Have it not include abilities in given items,
   have it properly deal with multiple underscores in arch names.
doc/spoiler-html/spoiler.html, doc/spoiler.ps: Rebuilt
MSW 2004-04-26

server/apply.c: apply_savebed() - make call to terminate_all pets before
   call to remove_ob() so that pets are properly removed.
common/item.c, server/c_object.c: Fix code so that skill tools (talismans,
  holy symbols, etc) are properly describe.  Clean up formatting of long_desc()
MSW 2004-04-25


Change most shop buy/sell functions to use 64 bit values.  Problem arises
where player would sell valuable item, and if they wanted to buy them back,
it would overflow a 32 bit value, so they could buy them back for free.
Note quite as odd when you consider the buy/sell price for really valuable
items to be very different.
include/global.h: Add UINT32_MAX and other max type defines for our typedef
   values so that we have standard setting of what the cap is.
server/apply.c: Change get_payment call to take second argument.
server/plugins.c: Add note about bug in handling of query_cost in this
   function.
server/shop.c: query_cost() now returns 64 bit.  Many other functions
   updated to also take/return 64 bit cost values.  Have cost_string
   nicely deal with values that are beyond affordability.  Rename get_payment2()
   to get_payment(), and remove the later, which was just a simple wrapper
   function that called get_payment2.
server/spell_effect.c: Update alchemy code.  Remove some suspect use of
   static values.
MSW 2004-04-24

server/apply.c: fix check_weapon_power() so it operates on overall character
  level and not skill level - this matches up what the out of skills
  displays.
MSW 2004-04-20

common/button.c: Patch by Bernd Edler to have proper speed set for items 
  activated by buttons.
server/apply.c: Apply the 'special prayer' marker stuff, since it wasn't
  used anymore.
server/gods.c: Check for FLAG_EQUIP on spells and not for a special prayer
  marker to guess if a spell is a god given spell or not.
server/spell_util.c: Patch by Bernd Edler so that firewalls are immune
  to casting time.
MSW 2004-04-17

server/shop.c: Decrease adjustment limit for expensive items to 10000 to get a
   continuous adjustment function. That is you will get much less when selling
   items with a value between 800pp and 2000pp.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-04-16

common/map.c: Change blocked_link() to take a map parameter.  Also, change code
   in blocked_link() to assume that the caller has set up appropriate map and
   coordinates related to tiling (in all functions that currently call
   blocked_link, this is the case)
include/libproto.h: Rebuilt.
server/move.c, server/player.c: update call to blocked_link to include the map.
MSW 2004-04-15

common/object.c: Change CAN_MERGE() so that it compares the stats structure of
  the objects being merged.  Fixes problems of rings improperly merging with
  other rings that have different stat values.
server/monster.c: Modify check_earthwalls() and check_doors() to take a
  map structure as an option parameter, and use that structure when
  calling get_map_ob.  Fixes a crash in cases where earthwalls/doors
  were at the edge of a tiled map, and creature was on other map moving into
  it.
server/move.c: Change move_ob() to adjust coordinates for tiling, and
  pass in these adjusted coordinages (and map) to the check_() functions
  in monster.c
random_maps/treasure.c: Apply patch by Andreas Kirschbaum so that it does
  more work in trying to place keys on maps.
MSW 2004-04-13

common/living.c: Patch by Bernd Edler to remove cap on exp for players.
MSW 2004-04-09

common/item.c: If potion wasn't given a random spell, use the archetype
   name when it is identified.
common/treasure.c: Fix potion codes so that healing and magic power potions
   get the proper spell inserted into them.  Also fix line termination issue.
server/skill_util.c: Add check in skill_attack() to make sure current_weapon
   is not null - there has been some crashes here, but I can't figure out
   how it gets to this state, so better to at least handle it.
MSW 2004-04-07

server/player.c: In flee_player(), make sure the enemy to the player is
   on an actual map - fixes crashes.
MSW 2004-04-06

common/potion.c: Fix up change_abil() to more properly deal with potions -
   characters could get 0 stat values.  Also, messages were not being properly
   displayed.  Patch is slightly modified from one sent in by Bernd Edler.
MSW 2004-04-05

server/main.c: Add extra checking for valid map coordinates after we grab
   them from the destination map itself - if a map is broken and has
   default enter_ coordinates outside the maps range, this previously
   resulted in a crash.
server/pets.c: Pass the correct map object into insert_ob_in_map().

server/attack.c: Add scare_creature() function, which sets FLAG_SCARED
   and also sets up appropriate enemy.  Clean up some formatting in
   other functions, and fix friendly fire - move it out of the loop for
   all attacktypes (can be after we have figured out max damage).  Also,
   has a bug where if an attach wasn't doing any damage, friendly fire could
   actually make it do damage (eg, fear spell).
server/player.c: Fix up flee_player() to be map tile aware.  Also, add
   call to flee_player() in handle_newcs_player() so player will run away.
MSW 2004-03-24

server/attack.c: Add missing skill=NULL in kill_object() - can be rare
   cases where the proper skill can't be found.
server/move.c: Fix push_object() so that it also updates the pushers/
   pushees map - should only happen in tiled map cases.
server/pets.c: Fix summon_object() so that if a summon cult monsters was
   cast, we try to find the god from the owner.  If still can't find the
   god, just return instead of crashing.
server/rune.c: Change trap_disarm() to call destroy_object() on the
   trap object, so that all the trapss inventory is also destroyed
   and not dumped on the ground.
server/skills.c: Only players without arms to steal.
server/spell_util.c: Change cast_spell to set up the skill pointer for the
   caster even if the caster is the wizard.
MSW 2004-03-22

server/treasure.c: patch from Bernd Edler to enable multiple
   'allowed' lines in artifacts.
Ryo 2004-03-12

Those fixes make DMs more 'stealthy' (when hiding/unhiding).
Also use yet unused colors for player join/leave, and DM join/leave.
This way those messages appear in a different window in split window
mode, to make the messages easier to spot.
server/apply.c: change color for player leave message.
server/c_misc.c: let DMs see hidden DMs.
server/c_wiz.c: make DMs more stealthy.
server/login.c: change color for player joining message.
server/main.c: change color for player joining/exiting message.
Ryo 2004-03-12

common/item.c: Fixed calc_item_power() to return valid item power for
   items with high enchantments.
Andreas Kirschbaum 2004-03-07

server/spell_effect.c: small patch by Karla Stenger to put player's name
   in the 'race' field of marking runes. This way, a DM can know who wrote
   a rune, in case it has some bad vocabulary :)
Ryo 2004-03-06

server/spell_attack.c: change check_cone_push function to use arch weights.
move function up for resuability and change to check_spell_knockback
include/sproto.h: change function name
TM 2004-02-28


common/image.c: removed unused variables.
common/item.c: conditionally remove unused variables.
common/map.c: conditionally define variables, unused under Windows.
include/global.h: turned off a conversion warning under Windows.
Ryo 2004-02-28


common/living.c: changed 'signed char' to 'sint8' for set|get|change_attr_value.
common/map.c: map size is sint16, for arch_blocked.
include/libproto.h: update prototypes for set|get|change_attr_value and arch_blocked.
random_maps/rproto.h: changed prototype for surround_flag3.
random_maps/wall.c: changed surround_flag3 to use sint16 instead of int for map
   coordinates.
server/apply.c: attribute values are sint8 in eat_special_food and
   apply_changes_to_player. Some explicit casts.
server/player.c: map coordinates are sint16, in hideability.
server/spell_attack.c: map coordinates are sint16, not int.
server/spell_effect.c: stats are sint8 in cast_change_ability. Map coordinates are
   sint16 in move_aura.
server/time.c: generate_monster doesn't return a value.
Ryo 2004-02-27


common/living.c: Have give_skill_by_name() update the skill pointers in the
   player object.
server/spell_attack.c: Properly set maxhp in the cone spell - this is used
   in ok_to_put_more() to make sure one spell doesn't hit a single space
   too many times.
MSW 2004-02-23

common/object.c: Change CAN_MERGE() so that we never merge applied objects -
   whether or not they are rings.
lib/*: different spell for dragons vs players for firebreath - update
   treasures so monsters use ability version.
server/gods.c: Add missing call to link_player_skills(), resulting in players
   having multiple praying skills.
server/skill_util.c: Change learn_skill() so we don't create a skill pointer
   for the player if they didn't learn the skill (even if they can't use
   such a created skill, it is still a bit confusing).  Fix finding of
   hand to hand skills to make sure the player can in fact use the skill
   in question.
server/spell_attack.c: Fix cast_cone() so that it properly hits all directions.
MSW 2004-02-22


include/define.h,server/shop.c: Apply patch by Bernd Edler that gives
   bargaining experience based on the amount of money a character saves.
   Higher the bargaining skill, the more money they can save.
MSW 2004-02-16

doc/Developers/spells: Update type on casting_time - include suggested value
  for times so that results are hopefully more coherent.
lib/archetypes, treasures.bld: rebuilt.
lib/treasures: Change some of the 'spelldirect' types to just the actual spells,
   so that two seperate archs don't have to be maintained.
server/c_wiz.c: Add some basic sanity checking to command_remove() so that
   we don't unnecessarily crash.
server/skills.c: write_scroll() - have it reset value of the scroll so that
   the scrolls so inscribed by players have better chance of merging.
server/spell_attack.c: cast_cone() - if the caster is a trap, have it hit
   the center space, so that characters who detonate cone traps will get hit
   by the effects.  Also, reduce range of cone spells if they are going
   in all directions, compared to being targetted in a speciifc direction.
server/spell_util.c: cast_spell() - put lower limit on player speed_left value
   when casting spells - since higher up the calling stack, the player speed
   is also reduced, we need to set the lower limit here so that the player
   isn't out of action longer than they should be.
MSW 2004-02-16

include/map.h: removed unused fields from wmapdef..
include/object.h: removed unused field from object.h. Changed glow_radius to sint8 to be
   coherent with struct MapSpace.
include/player.h: removed unused fields from player structure.
server/apply.c: removed unused known_spell field.
Ryo 2004-02-16

common/object.c: change get_owner() so that it also returns no valid owner if
   the owner is removed.  This fixes a crash if a player quits but is still
   sitting at the play again prompt when something he owns kills something.
server/skill_util.c: Fix show_skills() so that if the character has too many
   skills for whatever reason, we don't crash, and instead print an error
   to the player.
server/spell_attack.c: Fix typo - not sure actual effect, but probably nothing
   good. '+ +' should just have been '+'
MSW 2004-02-12

common/Makefile.am: Clean up proto - lex seems to toss some new symbols in
  now days.
common/map.c, common/object.c, server/player.c, socket/item.c,
   socket/request.c: change parameters of get_map_from_coord from int to
   sint16, so the op->x,op->y can get passed directly in.  Update callers of
   this function.
lib/archetypes: Add damned 1 to the shop floors.
server/pets.c: Fix problem with big (multisquare) pets following the owner
   across tiled map boundaries.
socket/item.c: Fix problem of players being able to see everything within
   containers by just looking at them.
MSW 2004-02-10

common/treasure.c: add_abilities(): For potions and horns (spell casting
   objects) convert the other_arch into a spell and put into the object -
   otherwise, the spell casting object casts the wrong spell.
common/object.c: Clean up formatting of copy_object.  Only real code change
  is to fix events - copied event data wasn't getting malloc'd, and thus
  when another object of that event was freed, it freed the event data
  for all objects derived from it.
common/treasure.c: Fix fix_generated_item() so that books generated by
   monsters with no_pick set don't inherit that for the book itself. 
   Still do it for other objects of the creator type.
MSW 2004-02-08

server/c_object.c: fixed sack_can_hold for the 'won't fit' cast,
    missing 'return 0'
server/gods.c: applied Karla Stenger's patch, making sure 'praying' is
    applied when becoming fellower of a god
Ryo 2004-02-08

Changed map-building to work on non-unique maps too.
server/build_map.c: removed check for unique map.
Ryo 2004-01-19


Added map-building code. This lets players change unique maps,
    adding & removing walls, doors, stuff like that.
	New item types BUILDER & MATERIAL. New item flag FLAG_IS_BUILDABLE.
	New range attack (builder).
----
Changelog: change prescribed date format to be coherent with usage :)
common/loader.l: added 'is_buildable' flag.
include/define.h: added defines for item types & subtypes, and item flag.
include/player.h: new range type 'builder'.
include/spropo.h: new function apply_map_builder.
server/apply.c: handle new range type.
server/build_map.c: new file, handles all build-related code.
server/c_object.c: added 'buildable item' to examine function.
server/Makefile.am: added build_map.c to compilation.
server/player.c: handle new range type.
socket/info.c: handle new range type.
Ryo 2004-01-18


Fix a crash related to plugin hooks
common/object.c: clear_object(): object's event's hook/plugin/options
    are initialized with FREE_AND_COPY, so they are shared strings.
    Better to release'em with FREE_AND_CLEAR_STR instead of
    FREE_AND_CLEAR, else nice crashes...
Ryo 2004-01-16

Fix writing not inserting correctly item in inventory, and Windows-
    specific stuff too
server/skills.c: write_scroll(): Better to insert spell in scroll,
    and not the other way around
server/skill_util.c: fix Windows-specific int64 stuff.
Changelog: fix Mark's 2003 to 2004 :)
Ryo 2004-01-16

Fix a bunch of crashes observed on metalforge:
server/player.c: do_hidden_move(): Move call to find skill so that it is
    always called.
server/skills.c: write_scroll(): Fix freeing of spell object in
    scroll - newscroll->inv isn't valid after calling remove_ob, so
    need to copy object to temporary pointer first.
server/spell_effect.c: cast_detection(): Pass in skill to use.  If no
    skill in use, use the caster object - fixes pointer derefence
    as op->chosen_skill wasn't always set.
server/spell_util.c: modify caster_level() to always return at least 1.
    Fixes pointer potential divide by zero problems - also guarantees
    that players will be able to cast first level spells even if 
    repelled to that spellpath.  ok_to_put_more() - Fix to use correct
    map pointer variable.  find_target_for_friendly_spell() - make it
    so it handles tiled maps OK.
MSW 2004-01-15

common/object.c: fix the monsters on tiled maps bug that I may have 
    mentioned a while ago.  Seems that the server assumed that all 
    parts of a multi part monster are on the same map as the head 
    while moving.  
DVS 2004-01-12

common/living.c: fix fix_player() so that character gets benefits/penalties
   for sp/hp/grace/etc regen bonuses as related to the god they worship.
server/player.c: dragon_ability_gain(): Modify so that character now gets
   attacktype of new ability that they gain.  Also, add code so that
   the characters face/animation can change (getting set to values the bonus
   ability).
MSW 2003-12-27

common/object.c: Set op->events=NULL in reset_object(), and move the
   clearing of the op->events structure to be before the memset in
   clear_object() - this was otherwise resulting in a memory leak,
   as memset would clear the pointer without actually freeing the data.
server/attack.c: Fix indentation of hit_map(), modify it so that attacks
   won't destroy items with no_pass set.
server/login.c: set op->speed=0, call update_ob_speed() before calling
   reset_object() - fixes problem with players not moving with recent
   changes to initting the active lists to NULL.
msw 2003-12-20


server/skills.c: changed NDI_UNIQUE to NDI_BLACK for the meditation
   message (so that messages can correctly be grouped, also makes it
   coherent with praying).
Ryo 2003-12-20

Those fixes deal with gcc3.3 infinite loop.
Fixes (except sizeof/memset) courtesy Bernd Edler.
---
common/item.c: use right buffer size for safe_strcat.
common/object.c: clear active_next and active_prev when cleaning an object.
include/define.h: fixed *curlen=maxlen-1; instead of *curlen=maxlen=1;
socket/init.c: initialize whole ns->inbuf.buf, instead of setting first
   element only to 0. Also allocated with a sizeof( unsigned char ) * size,
   in case size changes one day. And initialize some more fields.
Ryo 2003-12-18


Those changes deal only with warning cleaning under Windows.
Mostly, using the right type at the right place, or doing explicit casts.
---
common/object.c: changed free_arr_[xy] to short[] instead of int[].
include/global.h: changed free_arr_[xy] to short[] instead of int[].
   Changed Windows-specific comments to C-style comments, not C++-style.
include/sockproto.h: play_sound_player_only takes sint8, not int, for
   coordinates. play_sound_map takes a short for the sound number.
socket/image.c: some type fixing, explicit casts.
socket/init.c: Windows-specific type fixing.
socket/lowlevel.c: explicit casts to char for SockList_AddInt64
socket/request.c: fixed types to match function parameters, or added
   explicit casts when needed.
socket/sound.c: play_sound_player_only takes sint8, not int, for
   coordinates. play_sound_map takes a short for the sound number.
Ryo 2003-12-14

server/rune.c: Fix it so that players won't be hit by traps if they are
    not next to them when set off (firing arrows at a door for example).
server/spell_util.c: Fix spell_failure() to properly damage player if they
   fumble.  Fix cast_spell() to not complain about not having enough
   grace if the spell doesn't take grace.  Add same check for mana, but that
   is much less likely, as harder to get negative mana.
socket/request.c: Fix problem where map sending code was not properly avoiding
   duplicating the head of a big image on multiple layers.  This bug most often
   manifested itself of player standing on lower right corner of large building,
   and something else standing on other portion of building - player would seem
   to disappear.
MSW 2003-11-30

lib/adm/collect_images.pl: forced binary mode for written files.
   This lets the script work correctly under Windows.
Ryo 2003-11-29

server/apply.c: correctly display learned skill's name, and not the
   scroll's.
server/skills.c: make 'sense curse' and 'sense magic' check items
   on the ground too.
Ryo 2003-11-25

common/loader.l, loader.c: Fix firewalls so that their spell is properly
   initialized - uses 'dam' and not sp for those objects
server/apply.c: Fix check_weapon_power so that it finds proper wc object.
   Fix unapply_for_ob so that it won't unequip cursed/damned weapons if
   player switches objects.
MSW 2003-11-11

bulk of this is to fix exp loss when changing gods if you have more than
2 billion exp, removal of spells when you switch levels, and not giving you
all new spells when you switch religions.
--
common/living.c: Update exp functions to be fully 64 bit aware.  Don't
   take away from player total exp if SK_SUBTRACT_SKILL_EXP is passed in.
common/utils.c: Add 64 bit version of random_roll(), called random_roll64()
lib/treasures:  Make indentation consistent for some treasures.
server/apply.c: Use the FLAG_STARTEQUIP to denote god given spells, instead
   of using special prayer markers.  This simplifies the spell learning
   and removal code.
server/gods.c: Make exp loss for changing religions 64 bit compliant.
  Fix become_follower() so that it doesn't give all the new gods special
  spells if you switch religions.  Fix code so that it properly removes
  all special prayers from previous god, and also print out message on what
  spells you lost.  Don't set the prayer skill as applied in various
  areas - this results in two skills being applied, which isn't proper.
MSW 2003-11-09

common/living.c: Win32 compilation fix (levels is sint64, not uint64)
include/plugin.h: new hooks for free & fix_player. Required for Win32.
include/plugproto.h: new prototypes for CFWFreeMemory and CFWFixPlayer,
   wrappers for free( ) and fix_player( ). Required for Win32.
include/sproto.h: added prototypes for new plugin hooks and improved tell
   command helper.
plugin/plugin_python.c: wrap calls to fix_player, free and free_object
   with plugin ones when memory allocated by CF's main exe. Required for
   Win32 to work correctly.
server/c_chat.c: improved 'tell' command to accept first letters of player
   name only, case-insensitive. If 2+ players match, returns with a failure
   message.
server/player.c: new function find_player_partial_name. Returns player whose
   beginning of name matches specified string, NULL if more than one matches.
   Fix move_player to check specified direction's validity.
server/plugins.c: added wrappers for free( ) and fix_player( ). Required for
   Win32 compatibility.
Ryo 2003-11-07

common/treasure.c, doc/Developers/spells: Fix generation of rods so they have
   enough charges to cast the spells.  Update documentation on what maxhp for
   the archetype of rods means.
MSW 2003-11-01

server/player.c: Fix crash in stand_near_hostile when it is called on
  tiled maps with player near edge.
MSW 2003-11-01

Various bug fixes:
common/arch.c: Fix item_matched_string() so that it only passes in the length
   of the pssed in name in the strncasecmp(), and not the shorter of the
   passed in string or item name.  Otherwise, if player does a 'drop wand of',
   unidentified wands (name just wand) would match.  Similarly, if a player
   did 'drop ringmail', unidentified rings would match, etc.
common/living.c: Fix fix_player() to always process the praying skill with
   respect to resistances and whatnot.  This is necessary because the
   god give abilities are put in this skill, and those shouldn't go away
   depending on if the skill is in use or not.  Also fix bug in add_exp
   routines which wasn't multiplying permanent exp by PERM_EXP_GAIN_RATIO
common/object.c: Fix find_obj_by_type_subtype() - had extraneous semicolon
   after the for loop, so the if code that was supposed to be for each object
   was never called and instead would crash as it would get called with tmp
   was null.
server/attack.c: Fix problem with kill_object() not finding proper skill -
   it would use the skill object instead of the skill.  Fix problem of
   poisoning not setting up proper skill name in poisoning object.
server/c_range.c: If player is invoking a spell, don't update their
   range_magic value.
server/skill_util.c: Fix divide by zero problem if improperly passed
   skill object.
MSW 2003-10-26

TRIGGER_MARKER:
common/glue.c, common/button.c, include/define.h, funcpoint.h, libproto.h
    server/init.c:   Add trigger_marker (type #52) which is a Marker that can be
    triggered. Useful for placing forces in player when connected trigger is tripped.  
TM 2003-10-26
 
common/glue.c, common/object.c, common/player.c, include/funcpoint.h,
    server/init.c, server/monster.c, server/shop.c, server/skill_util.c:  add
    find_skill_by_number() function - this replaces find_skill.  Locate new
    function in skill_util.c, which is more a proper place than
    common/player.c - this change necessitated adding glue function pointers
    so the other common files can call it.
server/spell_effect.c: Fix cast_heal() so if the spell is not one that heals
    hit points, don't process the code that checks for that and sets
    a false success value.
socket/metaserver.c: Clean up formatting - no code changes.
MSW 2003-10-25

server/apply.c: small fix to apply_spellbook in the rare case when
   the spellbook contains no spell (happens when DM issues a bad
   'create' command for instance :).
Ryo 2003-10-04

server/c_new.c: fix command_run and command_fire so they check
   the given direction is [0..8]. This enabled weird things like
   hitting non-adjacent monsters.
   Patch by Karla Stenger on cf-devel, slightly modified by me.
Ryo 2003-10-21

common/arch.c: fix item_matched_string() so that matching makes sense -
   the ordering was wrong, so that we would match something with a low
   priority, and skip over looking to see if that same object would get
   a better match.  Order the function so that we look for the best
   matches first.
MSW 2003-10-08

socket/request.c: Clean up some compile warnings.  Improve big face
  handling - there were cases where data wasn't being sent when
  it should have, and vice versa.  Basically, do better checking
  to see if we should send a big face for a particular layer, and
  also better checking to make sure we don't send the same face more
  than once for the same layer.  Also, change esrv_map_scroll() 
  to clear out spaces that appear into view - adds a little extra bandwdith,
  but necessary because otherwise the fact there is a big face on the edge
  doesn't always get sent.
MSW 2003-10-07

TODO: various updates.
common/button: Old patch by David Seikel: change inventory checkers so that
   the monster/player is also checked against.  And do more proper for checkers
   that check against slaying or race - if the trigger doesn't have
   those set, we don't want to compare a null against another null and
   get success).
server/apply.c: Change apply_shop_mat() so that it removes unpaid objects from
   monsters (or thrown containers for that matter).  Old patch by Bernd Edler
   to improve messages dragons get for eating various food types.
server/player.c: Add another missing call to fix_player().  Modify
   move_player_attack() so that the target player doesn't hit back if
   they are the WIZ or on a battleground
MSW 2003-10-06

utils/player_dl.html utils/player_dl.pl.in: New files - scripts for allowing
   character directories to be downloaded over the web.
configure.ac: Add check for 'tar', so that we can put it in the script above.
Makefile.in (All of them): Changed because TAR variable propogated to them.
MSW 2003-09-30

server/time.c: Real change is to add a missing call to fix_player - without
   this new players would be getting messed up maxsp/maxgrace values.  Cleaned
   up formatting in move_player_changer() while doing the other change.
   MSW 2003-09-28

common/living.c, include/libproto.h: Update some functions to take 64 bit int
   values for exp usage.
random_maps/random_map.c: Don't ever make rogue maps symmetric -
   creates unconnected maps.  Clean up layoutgen() to not have a bunch
   of duplicated code.
MSW 2003-09-25

server/skill_util.c: Call esrv_send_inventory on the cauldron if we

	Added friendly_fire to attack.c, called from hit_player.
	Will put a cap on maxdam that is a percentage (1-100%) of damage (min
	1) based on SET_FRIENDLY_FIRE value when players attack in peaceful
	mode.  Changed who, statistics to show this setting better and added
	help file for peaceful.  It would be nice to have a indicator in the
	client for this as well.  TM - 2003-08-25
	
protocol/doc/code:
	Changed the way smoothing is done. Switched the smooth 
	command to binary mode, rebuild archetype files, added doc 
	on smoothing, updated protocol file. 
	Changed a the "togglemapextended smoothing" to "togglemapextended
	smooth" to prevent problem of compatibilities with previous cvs
	smoothing releases.
Tchize 2003-07-08

protocol: 
	Added new command to send extended map informations to the
	client. Mainly used for now to send smoothing informations.
	Also commented the modifications in the protocol file ind doc/
lib/Makefiles:
	Changed to install the smooth file too. Needed by smooth code
common/loader.l and loader.c
	completly reworked get_ob_diff to improve speed at mapsave time.
	For now function is interlaced with commented old code. Will clean
	up when code will be proved working. (hope middle of july)
Tchize 2003-07-03

server/apply.c: Fix auto_apply - missing else, causing extra
   treausres to be generated inside of shop tiles.
server/monster.c: Fix npc_call_help to be map tile aware.
MSW 2003-06-18

lib/collect.pl.in: Modify it so that it will collect .trs (treasure) files and
   build a treasures.bld from that as well as the existing treasures file.  In
   this way, treasure information for objects can be put in the arch
   directory.
lib/Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Modified so that it copies over the
   treasures.bld to treasures in the destination directory.  Have
   the collect directive also build the images, so that a double
   make isn't necessary.
lib/treasures.bld: Added file - like the archetypes, this is the pre-
   build treasure file.  Until .trs files are added, this will just
   match the treasures file with some additional comments.
MSW 2003-05-26

common/map.c: Fix bug causing unnecessary crashes - ok for the map
    to match if the object has been removed.
socket/loop.c: Only make call to draw_client_map() if we have a valid
    map to draw.
MSW 2003-05-26

common/anim.c: Patch by AV to make sure multipart monsters animations
   stay in sync.  MSW 2003-05-25

server/apply.c: Fix bug in that we weren't calling esrv_map_scroll()
   when player used a shop map but lacked sufficient funds to pay
   for his items.
MSW 2002-05-23

common/item.c, common/utils.c, include/config.h: Add #define NEW_MATERIAL_CODE
   and checks in the other files for this - if this is commented out
   (default), then the new material naming code is disabled - material
   names won't be put in the items names as shown in the inventory
   (can still see material by examining an object), and objects that are
   created will be created with the default material (eg, iron for
   most armor/weapons, eg, brass, bronze, copper items won't show
   up anymore).
lib/settings: Add comments from the old config.h file that describes
   what the options already does.  Having no comments in this file
   or in config.h anymore is very unfriendly.
MSW 2003-05-20

server/player.c: Have players start at max hp/grace/sp.
MSW 2003-04-14

server/c_range.c: Add check to make sure we are actually removing a
   golem and that the object hasn't been freed/recycled and the
   player not updated.  Fixes crashes.
MSW 2003-04-13

acinclude.m4: Update path to find python includes, since aclocal.m4 gets 
   derived from this file.
configure.ac, configure: Add utils/scores.pl to list of files to substitute on.
common/loader.l, loader.c: Add subtype for objects - will be used in future work.
common/object.c: Add subtype diff check in CAN_MERGE()
common/porting.c: Have it use SAVE_DIR_MODE when doing the mkdir, and not have
   hardcoded 777 permissions.
doc/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.am, doc/Developers/Makefile.am,
   doc/Developers/Makefile.in: Move some of the spell docs around and merge
   them together
doc/Developers/objects: Add notes about subtype.
doc/Developers/spells: New file, contains preliminary work on spell objects.
include/config.h: Remove command about DM_MAIL and LIBDIR from file, as they
   are options no longer present.  Update comment about SAVE_MODE, and add
   SAVE_DIR_MODE
include/object.h: Add subtype field to object.
server/login.c: Have it use SAVE_DIR_MODE when doing the mkdir, and not have
   hardcoded 6700 permissions.
utils/Makefile.in: Updated to know about scores.pl
utils/scores.pl.in: New file - reads player file to generate HTML score
   file.
MSW 2003-04-04

TODO: Various update
aclocal.m4,configure: Update path to find python (fix again)
common/image.c: Minor update to a ocmment in the code.
common/los.c: Add missing P_OUT_OF_MAP checks that resulted in some incorrect
    LOS calcuations.
include/funcpoint.h: Remove draw_func function pointer.
lib/Makefile.am, in: Remove bmaps.paths to from being installed or being part
    of distribution - bmaps.paths is only needed when collecting the image
lib/*: Rebuilt
server/c_object.c: Patch by Bernd Edler to have the apply functions take into
   acount if the item is equipped or not when looking for good matched items.
server/commands.c: Move printlos to normal commands.  I don't think it reveals
    any information that is in any way harmful.  And since it dumps the
    output to the players screen, no concern of it filling up log files.
    Also, when doing LOS debugging, it is pointless to have it as a DM command
    because LOS is ignored for DM's.
server/disease.c: Modify remove_symptoms to remove all symptoms the player
    may have a disease.  Modify infect_object() to not allow a creature to
    have more than one instance of the same disease.
socket/info.c: remove draw() - instead, draw_client_map() can be used,
    as that is most the only thing draw() did anyways.
socket/loop.c: Update draw() calls to draw_client_map()
socket/request.c: Remove special handling for darkness==4 cases (first
    space that is in full darkness) - this is extra complications and causes
    display problems.  Update draw_client_map() to include the little bit
    of logic that draw() had that this function did not have.
MSW 2003-04-01


common/glue.c, include/funcpoint.h: remove draw_func() pointer - no longer
   needed, so code that sets up pointer removed.
lib/*: rebuilt - facings added to old player animation information.
   ruined_temple archetype added.
server/init.c: remove set_draw() function
server/player.c: remove call to draw() - socket code takes care of this.
MSW 2003-03-24

server/spell_effect.c: Some code cleanuip to cast_change_attr - mostly
   to combine the processing of the stat improving spells together.
   The actual change to playability is that bless and holy possession
   don't stack if cast multiple times.
server/spell_util.c: Modify create_aura so that player can't have more than
    one aura (of the same type) active at a time.
MSW 2003-03-20

server/apply.c: Change weapon improving code to only use up the number of
    potions that it needs, and not all on the ground.  Required adding
    another arg to eat_item() which is the number of items to consume.
include/sproto.h: Rebuilt for new eat_item() (actually, a static, so no
    longer shows up in this file)
server/attack.c: Change did_make_save to strip out magic attacktype when making
    saves for objects - otherwise, things like poison cloud destroy objects.
server/time.c: deal with player animations special in process_object - need to
    pass in the facing value, and not direction, since direction gets reset.
MSW 2003-03-19

common/anim.c: Pass direction to animate_object() - needed for player
   animations as player's facing may not match direction.
crossedit/Attr.c, server/main.c, server/time.c: Update calls to animate_object()
include/libproto.h: rebuilt
include/newserver.h, plugin_animator/animator_box.c, socket/init.c,
    socket/request.c: Remove newanim field from socket structure - not needed -
    how to animate is determined by object, not by socket.
server/move.c: Add check to P_OUT_OF_MAP in teleport function.
server/player.c: change move_player to call animate_object, so it gets full
   power of functionality it supports instead of 4 way hardcode animation
   information.
server/spell_effect.c: When altars are consecrated, don't look to arch name
   for first portion of name - always call them Altar of %s - fixes problem
   where altar is special god altar that has god's name in archetype, resulting
   in altar of .. of ...
MSW 2003-03-18

Patch for 64 bit experience total, as well as flexible number of levels.
Basically, max level is now dynamic, set in exp_table file.  Experience
is now a 64 bit value, so much higher totals now allowed.  To 
allow for flexible levels, add new function - did_make_save() which is used
for players/monsters to see if they make their saving throw - this is
necessary because the savethrow[] array may not be as large as max level -
did_make_save takes this into account.
NOTE: If your updating a server, you will need to copy over/set up a
new exp_table file that has max_levels defined and at least one of the
tables uncommented.  There are no longer any compiled in defaults
--
configure, configure.ac: Add AC_CHECK_SIZEOF calls for long and long long
   so we can know which one to use for 64 bit support (other checks
   may need to be added)
common/exp.c: Remove levels table, replace it with a 64 bit pointer.
   Change init_experience to allocate appropriately sized table, have it
   read max_level value from exp_table file.  Replace atoi calls with
   atoll to get 64 bit value.  Update dump_experience to properly
   print 64 bit values.
common/info.c: Update dump routines that dump exp to properly print
   64 bit values.
common/init.c: Add initializing for settings.max_level value.
common/item.c: Update sprintf's to handle 64 bit output of exp (speed)
   value in objects.
common/living.c: change MAX_EXP define, update MAX_EXP_IN_OBJ define,
   add MAX_SAVE_LEVEL which corresponds to how large the savethrow
   table is.  Change MAXLEVEL to settings.max_level.  Change level_exp()
   to return 64 bit value, other updates in functions to use 64 bit
   values.  Add did_make_save() function.
common/loader.l, common/loader.c: Update load/save routins of exp to 
   deal with 64 bit values.
common/map.c: Update calculate_difficulty to use 64 bit values when
   storing exp - unlikely to make a difference, since unlikely any map
   will get to a point where it has that much exp on it.
common/porting.c: Remove dead code from save_long(), add save_long_long()
   to save 64 bit values.
include/autoconf.h.in: SIZEOF_LONG and SIZEOF_LONG_LONG values added.
include/global.h: Add code to typedef sint64/uint64 types based on what
   type gives us those values.  Add max_level to settings array.
include/libproto.h: rebuilt.
include/living.h: Replace exp field with 64 bit value.
include/player.h: Update party kill log exp tracking to have 64 bit
   values.
lib/exp_table: Udpate comments about max_level, uncomment what
   was the default table so new installs have working table.
   Add 5 levels to all the tables.
random_maps/monster.c: Update place_monsters to use 64 bit when storing
   exp total for map/per square.
server/apply.c: Replace MAXLEVEL with settings.max_level, add
   did_make_save calls where appropriate
server/c_misc.c: have statistics command properly print 64 bit
   exp value.
server/c_wiz.c: Have stats command properly display 64 bit value.
server/hiscore.c: Replace exp values with 64 bit values, update to
   properly load/display them.
server/player.c: replace savethrow[] reference with did_make_save()
server/skill_util.c: Update skills command to properly show 64 bit exp values.
server/spell_effect.c: replace savethrow[] reference with did_make_save(),
   allow players to cast directors right beneath themselves, but other
   walls must be on empty space.
MSW 2003-03-07

Various bug fixes.
crossedit/Attr.c: Minor cleanup to eliminate some compile time warnings.
plugin/plugin_python.c: Remove some unused variables, thus fixing up some
    compiler warnings.
random_maps/random_map.c, random_maps/random_map.h, random_maps/special.c:
    Add MIN_RANDOM_MAP_SIZE values instead of hardcode constants.
server/monster.c: Fix communicate - odd bug can be map gets swapped out
    just after player is transferred to another map, causing crashes as
    map that was originally spoken on is no longer in memory.
server/rune.c: add missing free_object call when erasing runes.
server/skills.c: Change write_on_item to determine type of writing based
   on content of mesage, or lack thereof, and not the marked object.
   Fix problem of buf not being initalized.
MSW 2003-03-06


Various bug fixes.
Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Put crossedit as the last directory, so any build
   errors for crossedit doesn't effect anything else.
README: Update ftp site listing.
TODO: More things aded.
aclocal.m4, configure: Add missing / when checking in /usr/local for
   python headers.
common/map.c: Add some debugging in free_all_objects that checks to make sure
   there are not objects remaining that belong to the map just freed -
   only active if MANY_CORES is set.
random_maps/random_map.c: Increase minimum random map size to 10x10 - this
   is need for square spirals to work properly I think.
server/spell_effect.c: Have perceive self tell dragon players what they are
   currently focused on.  Fix town portal to remove force objects from
   players if destination is no longer available.
server/swap.c: Reset maps reset_time when loading them in in read_map_log() -
   this is only used if recycle temp maps is on.  Also, do sanity checking
   on reset_time value - bogus values were observed on metalforge.
socket/request.c: Update map timeout in draw_client_map() - in this way,
   we don't swap out a map within a players view only to swap it back
   in.
MSW 2003-03-01

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 1.5.0:

*/Makefile.in, related files:  Updated for 1.5.0
server/attack.c: Don't change weak wall image if no damage was actually done.
server/c_object.c: Include math.h - needed for pow()
server/spell_effect.c: fix infinite loop in town_portal
MSW 2003-02-24

common/anim.c: Fix for 8 way facing animations.
lib/treasures: Add sheep treasures
lib/* (rest) - rebuilt
server/spell_effect.c: Fix up counterspell - mainly fix a bug in that if
   counterspell hit a multipart magic that used magic as an attacktype,
   it would also crash.  However, code also woudln't work properly on
   tiled maps, and I'm dubious if it would work properly if there was more
   than one effect on a space.
MSW 2003-02-23

server/skills.c: Fix jump so that it updates the clients map properly.
server/spell_effect.c: insert town portals below the player so it
   works better with apply.
MSW 2003-02-20

server/move.c: Fix transfer_ob so that it sends newmap command to client
   if we're moving a playing - otherwise fog of war displays bad
   information on the client.
MSW 2003-02-19

More bugfixes:
server/c_wiz.c: Fix reset command - while it deleted the maps, it made things
   so that it never got removed from the map listing - instead, just let
   flush_old_maps do most of the work.
server/main.c: If player tries to enter a random map that has been reset
   and that we have no informatino about (eg, going up in a dungeon),
   just say the exit is closed instead of making a completely random map 
   that usually isn't in keeping with the dungeon (and still won't lead
   outdoors)
server/move.c: In move_teleporter(), change it so that if a player uses
   a shop map yet there is no place to put the player, just drop him on
   top of a monster - this fixes problem of players getting trapped inside
   of shops in random dungeons.
MSW 2003-02-16

random_map/random_map.c: Include parameters used to make map in msg of map -
   this can hopefully be used to debug what is really happening when bad
   maps are made.
server/rune.c: Modify dispel_rune function (called from disarm spell)
   to erase marking runes.  While at it, fix it so that it does the right
   thing with respect to tiled maps.
MSW 2003-02-15

include/sproto.h, server/move.c:  Modify try_fit() to take mapstruct parameter
   for which map we are trying to fit this on - fixes problems with rolling
   boulders accross map (only function that currently uses this).
MSW 2003-02-14

common/item.c: make item_power stop showing up in ring short descriptions.
        fix some of the items that were double-displaying materialnames, like
        mithril mithril chainmail.
common/loader.l: add tooltype
common/utils.c: Unless the object is armour or weapons, pick the first
        materialname we find.  Now, newly generated diamonds will stack.
        Fix name_to_material to return NULL if it finds nothing, fixes
        navar_city/museum crash.
        Change set_materialname to take a materialtype_t argument, allowing
        functions to manually set the materialname, rather than let the
        randomizer pick for them.
include/define.h:  Add TOOL and BUILDFAC for item building.
include/object.h:  add tooltype for item building.
include/materials.h: add M_SPECIAL.  Set this in an object, to prevent things
        like mithril mithril chainmail.  This is primarily only needed in
        artifacts, because they change the base material of the arch.  Also
        useful in things like the demonspawn shield, and on maps.
lib/artifacts: sprinkle M_SPECIAL around.
server/player.c: remove auto_heal.  This never should have been
        committed, and was never referenced by any code.
server/c_object.c:  add item building, but add it disabled.  Too many
        bugfixes were tied in with this code to cleanly add them. When
        enabled, this code will add player item building, similar to
        create to take place.  Requires a host of graphics and arches
        to be useable.
garbled 2003-02-13

random_maps/special.c: Fix possible bug with placement of special maps.
Add lore/endlore to object structure to hold general information about objects:
common/loader.c, common/loader.l: Add loading and saving of lore field.
common/object.c: handle lore field for copy/free/other object operations.
   Also, update CAN_MERGE to look at materialname also.
doc/Developers/objects: Add notes about lore.
include/object.h: add lore field to object.
server/apply.c: Fix bug in that cursed weapons were not equipped/
   unequipped.
MSW 2003-02-11

doc/Developers/objects: Add nodes about shared strings in objects.
server/c_misc.c: Remove check for name length - check_name takes care
    of that for us.
server/monster.c: store return value from get_map_flags - seen some
    crashes traced back to this area, want to see what it returned.
    Allow objects with no msg to still use scripts that listen.
server/player.c: Fix potentional issue of freeing/adding players name
    when they enter play again - seen some crashes attributed to 
    odd names.
MSW 2003-02-08


More bugfixes:
server/player.c: Fix permadeath without resurrection - wasn't deleting
    player save files as it was supposed to.  If permadeath +
    resurrection was in use, I believe it all worked as expected.
include/shop.h: remove _SHOP_H after endif, causing compiler warnings.
include/skills.h: Add check to USING_SKILL to make sure chosen_skill
   is not null.
server/c_chat.c: Add some missing return values, resulting in compiler
   warnings.
server/skill_util.c: Remove unused variable.  compiler warnings again.
server/spell_effect.c: Change dimension door so that you can't go
   through spaces that block passsage and also block view (eg walls).
   This goes back to the more traditional behaviour.  Remove
   some unused variables.
server/spell_util.c: Add missing P_OUT_OF_MAP to move_missile, resulting
   in crashes.
server/time.c: if generator is not on a map, don't have it generates.
   Fixes crashes.
MSW 2003-02-02

New materialtype system for crossfire.  Based in concept on my original
design, but rewritten from scratch to make it easily extensible.

In a nutshell:

Each of the old materialtypes (metal, glass, stone, wood) are now a class
of materials.  When an item in the game is created, if it does not have a
specific materialname of it's own, a materialname is generated randomly
from the matching entries in the "lib/materials" file.  This file
contains all of the saving throws, and other material specific
modifications for each of the expanded materials.

Materials can be manually specified in the arch with the "materialname"
directive.  Such as the gold coins, which are specified to be made of,
you guessed it, gold.

Saving throws have been slightly rewritten to use the new materialtypes,
and a few other minor details associated with materialtypes have been
patched up.

Adding a new type of stone or wood, is as simple as adding a new entry in
the lib/materials file.  The game will automatically start distributing
them around randomly.

Various bug fixes:
common/item.c: If nrof of an item is 0, have it print singular name and
   not plural name.
server/c_object.c: Fix typo when printing value of optoins - had an
   extra 'the' in place.  Also, don't print value of objects with
   no pick flag set.
server/login.c: Enforce maximum name length for new characters.
server/monster.c: Change parsing code for messages/@match code -
   new code is simpler, and should also be simpler and less bug
   ridden, but otherwise functionally equivalant.  Also fix up
   communicate to work properly on tiled maps.
server/spell_effect.c: fix up move_aura to not crash hopefully.
MSW 2003-01-26

More bug fixes:
common/item.c: Add missing braces - was resulting in some items getting
    display like 'gauntlets of strength (Str+1)(Str+1).
include/map.h: Add MAGIC_MAP definitions to the file.
server/shop.c: Put back in code that uses magic_mapping_mark to determine
    what items to display in inventory.  Update for new one magic mapping
    code stores information away.
server/spell_util.c: Add missing P_OUT_OF_FLAG check, which resulted
   in crashes.
socket/info.c: Move MAGIC_MAP definations to map.h.  Add check for
    P_OUT_OF_MAP.  Remove code that stops on P_NO_MAGIC - with that
    it wouldn't search the shops.
MSW 2003-01-16

server/move.c: fix try_to_fit and roll_ob to work properly on tiled maps.
Also some performance improvements to those functions.
MSW 2003-01-12

Bulk of this commit is to improve code for tiled maps - replace
wall/blocks_magic/blocks_cleric, etc with get_map_flags which
also does map tiling translation as needed.  This should fix a lot
of the bugs related to map tiling (there are sure to be more out
there - all the get_map_ob still need to be checked).
Other changes - many spells stopped progressing on spaces that
blocked view - that is now removed - didn't make a lot of sense.
Other fixes - some cleric spells (eg, word of recall) checked to
see if magic was prohibited, didn't check to see if cleric
was prohibited.
Clean up some bugs in the lighting code that would cause erroneous
results.  Also, allow players to see immediately around them on
outdoor maps no matter how dark the map really is - behaviour
on indoor maps is the same.
Lots of code reformatted, and lots of obsoleted/dead code removed.
Add max range to dimension door.
Fix magic map - got broken when the layer stuff was redone - was
not showing proper colors.  IT also works sensibly on tiled maps
now - rather than display based on the map, it gives the player a
50x50 area centered on where the player is.
Change fire_bow - move special player fire modes into own function -
makes code much cleaner.
Hopefully this fixes more bugs than it introduces.

   to enchant as normal armor is enchanted, also only allows one
   item to be enchanted.
MSW 2002-01-07

common/item.c: Add 'unidentified' to display of examined items if the
   item has not been identified.  Only display spell regen penalty
   for armour if there is in fact a penalty.
lib/archetypes: rebuilt for updated demon speed, pick up other new archs.
lib/animations, lib/bmaps lib/bmaps.paths lib/crossfire.0 lib/crossfire.1
lib/faces: rebuilt
server/main.c: Name random maps based on final map component (if available)
   or map they are spawned from - this gives so clue in 'who' command
   where the players really are.
server/monster.c: Fix code that would cause monsters to ignore golems/
   avatars.
server/pets.c: Clean up a few warnings, fix bug in pet_move that caused
   crashes - owner of a pet isn't always a player.
server/player.c: Remove on_same_map check - can_detect_monster also
   performed check, so no need to have extra call.
server/spell_effect.c: modify alchemy to properly deal with tiled maps,
   change behavior for spells that block view - they no longer block
   alchemy, but spaces that block magic will.
MSW 2002-01-05

TODO - add notes about item damage - clear it out of my mailbox.
common/loader.l, loader.c: Add check at load time to see if monsters
   hp is higher than its maxhp and print a debug message if so.
devel/Makefile: Remove - makefiles shouldn't be in CVS, only .in versions.
server/attack.c: Fix calculation of max_damage in kill_object - this
   was being done incorrectly, resulting in fired spell objects causing
   incorrect amounts of damage, resulint in some monsters ending up with
   a lot of hp.  Fix call to kill_object to pass in correct damage value.
server/monster.c: Put in check so that monster won't regen to more hp
   than they should have.
server/spell_util.c: Removed unused variable from move_missile.
server/weather.c: fix bug that causes crash if empty space is encountered
   on map.
MSW 2003-01-03

socket/request.c: Fix buffer (malloc) overrun in esrv_send_stats - more
  stuff has gotten to be added, without ever increasing the size of the
  buffer to hold it.
MSW 2003-01-01

server/time.c: Fix bad code in stop_arrow that caused crashes/improper
freeing of data.
MSW 2002-12-30

common/treasure.c: Fix initialization of treasure structs to use calloc.
server/player.c: Fix infinite loop.
socket/loop.c: Make sure we put in null terminator for socket data.

New Arrow and Pet Code:
Add bowmode and petmode commands.  Allowing the player to change the firing
style for bows to one of either threewide, or spreadshot.
Allow players to change the operating modes of his pet with petmode.  Can be
either seek and destroy, defend, or normal historical behavior.
Change bows to impart speed to arrows based on damage and other magical
plusses.  Damage decays over distance, to stop arrows from flying forever.
Very fast moving arrows will pierce multiple targets.  An arrow moving at a
speed greater than 10.0 will go straight through a target, losing 1.0 of
speed in the process.
Change magic missile to use spell_find_dir instead of find_dir to stop it
from flying in a circle and hitting the caster, and to make it stop
flying into walls to hit creatures behind the walls.

Various bug fixes:
common/living.c: Reset glow_radius for players, so they stop glowing
   after they snuff out their torch or whatever.
server/apply.c: Fix message about improving armour so that it is now
   accurate.
server/monster.c: Add some debug lines that may show cause of excess
   monster hp.
server/spell_effect.c: fix compile warning in summon_pet().  Clean up
   indentation of alchemy functions, but functional changes is to
   insert gold nuggets below player (so more of the actions work),
   as well as to reset the view position, so that it won't have the
   'previous 50' object selection.  Add suggested parens in
   cast_detection.
server/weather.c: Fix crash in weather code if snow was only object
   on space.
MSW 2002-12-20

server/weather.c:
More weather routines:

Now the game will attempt to completely reformat the world, and modify it
with the weather and elevation.  When dynamiclevel is set to 5 or above,    
the game looks at each tile, and the weather conditions present in that
tile.  It then consults a table of different terrain types, and what
conditions they prefer to grow under.  If the conditions match the spot,    
and there is nothing special about the spot (like a house, or a road),   
then we drop the new tile type on the overlay map on that location.

Tuning of this can be done at the top of weather.c, by changing the
weather_tile array.

Also.. add a feather_map() routine which tries to break up the blockiness
of some of the weather effects by spreading the tiles around.

This code works.. but needs tuning, and probably a little more testing.
Some of the conditions for the various tiles really need to be looked at,    
and fiddled with.

common/exp.c: Fix bug were drain attacks added exp.
MSW 2002-12-05

server/player.c: Change move_player_attack() so that we look for monsters
   to attack even after finding a rollable object - there can be non
   blocking rollable objects with monsters on top - we want to attack
   the monster, not roll the object.
MSW 2002-12-03

TODO: Move more items from my mailbox to the TODO list.
common/living.c: Init item_power in player to zero in fix_player() - 
    bogus results were getting generated as it just kept getting incremented.
common/porting.c: fix remove_directory so it works properly - checking
    for . and .. entries too late, calling unlink instead of rmdir.
include/sproto.h: rebuilt
lib/animations, lib/archetypes, lib/bmaps, lib/bmaps.paths, lib/crossfire.0,
    lib/crossfire.1, lib/faces: Rebuilt - new archs added, catch is_thrown
    addition to thrown rock/boulder archs.
server/c_move.c, server/c_range.c: Add another parameter to do_skill() - part, which
    is closest part of creature to target object - current only used
    for the throw code.  Update calls to this function to add additional
    parameter.
server/c_object.c: Remove the NDI_UNIQUE from the 'item is too heavy
    to pick up' so that it won't flood the client with them if players
    goes onto space with lots of objects.
server/main.c: Minor cleanup to fix compiler warning about ambigous
    if/else.
server/monster.c: Pass closest part of monster when having it use
    a skill so that it doesn't throw rocks into itself.  Update calls to
    do_skill as described above.
server/player.c: Cal delete_player() when player quits - this properly
    cleans up any per player unique maps they have.  Also, check for
    any such maps currently in memory, and delete those so that unique
    maps don't get 'gifted' to the next character of the same name.
    Update calls to do_skill as described above.
server/shop.c: Combine items of the same name together in the output 
    of the shop listings.  Include the number of items, remove special
    casing of some objects so that query_base_name is used for all item
    types.
server/skill_util.c: Modify do_skill() to take additional param as
    described above.  Also, have do_skill return 1 on success,
    0 on failur to use skill, and not return exp - otherwise,
    monster code has no idea if skill was successfully used, as throw
    doesn't grant exp, and this caused monsters to move into the
    object they just threw.  Update calls to do_skill as described
    above.
server/skills.c: Clean up skill_throw function to return meaningfull
    value.  Also, pass along extra part of closest monster part
    to target.  Modify do_throw to return value, use closest
    part of body as origin point for thwon object.
server/spell_effect.c: Use isqrt function instead of definining
    ISQRT that used float version.  Cleans up compile warning - most 
    likely not seen before as spell was #ifdef SPELL_ENCUMBERANCE out.
server/time.c: Put sanity checking for players speed_left in 
    move_player_mover() - got some reports of infinite negative speed
    on metalforge, and this is the only place in the code where I could
    see that happening given the description of the events.
utils/arch2xml.py, utils/cfarches.xsl: New script (and template) by
    Todd Mitchell.  Script can convert archs to xml, and the template
    is usuable with mozilla to look at the output.

common/object.c, include/object.h: Add INS_BELOW_ORIGINATOR flag to
    insert_ob_in_map - this is used for treasure chests so the
    treasure is put below the player.  Also fix insertiong of items
    on spaces that block view - put them in proper order, and not just
    directly above the floor
server/apply.c: Tell player what level they need to be if they are not
    of sufficient level to improve armor.  Modify apply_treasure to
    use INS_BELOW_ORIGINATOR flag, clean up some of the other logic
    in apply_treasure.
server/c_object.c: Modify command_take to use the container inventory 
    when doing a pickup, and not the container itself.

common/map.c: Fix up some formatting - no code change.
include/player.h, server/apply.c, server/player.c, socket/info.c: Remove
    chosen_item_spell field - isn't needed anymore as that information
    is determined each time player fires wand/rod/horn.  This fixes
    those items firing magic bullets if they were equipped when player
    saved and rejoined.  Some additional cleanup done in rangetostring() -
    mostly formatting changes, but minor code changes.
MSW 2002-11-29
    

include/shstr.h: Update REFCOUNT_TYPE to be an int - seems to at least fix

New alchemy code, as discussed on the developer list.  Now recipies include
two new tags: skill and cauldron.  With skill, you can set which skill
activates this recipie, and the cauldron, corresponds to the arch name of    
the facility you will use when creating the item.  In this way, item
creation is now more generalized than just alchemy, and specific formulae    
can be written to utilize different skills, or perhaps special formulae
would require a hard-to-find cauldron.

Functionally, the alchemy, or alchemy-like-skills are now activated by    
the use_skill command.  The secondary use of the alchemy spell has been
withdrawn, so now it functions in the way it was originally intended again.

socket/loop.c: add a setting fastclock.  This makes the server's clock run
*really* fast.  For now, it's good for debugging purposes, but in the
future it will allow a dm to ravage a world with weather quickly. 
include/define.h: add FLAG_IS_WATER
include/global.h: add fastclock to settings
include/map.h: add water to weathermap structure
include/sproto.h: add tons of new functions in weather.c
common/init.c: update for FLAG_IS_WATER
common/loader.l: update for FLAG_IS_WATER
server/init.c: add code to read fastclock setting
server/weather.c: Complete update, largely rewritten.  Now the world is 
cut into a 100x100 matrix of weathermaps.  Each one of these maps is 
computed at initial boot, and written to disk, following which, they are 
simply read from disk at boot.  For each of the main weather types 
(pressure, humitidy, base temperature, wind direction, wind speed) the 
game recomputes the entire weathermap, applying smoothing algorithims, or 
derriving each map from it's predecessor.  Weathermaps are only used if 
you have set your dynamiclevel to 1 or greater, and, are using the bigmap 
set.  At this time, there is still no functional change to the game, 
bigmap, or not.
utils/maps.c: This program will generate ppm files from each of the
weathermaps. Mostly for debugging, but curious DM's might find it useful 
to see the weather.

server/c_chat.c: Fix some buffer overflow issues - use snprintf or
   use new_draw_info_format instead.
lib/artifacts: Update some cloaks not to require a minimum magic level,
   since that will never be met.
MSW 2002-10-16

Minor bugfixes:
common/living.c: Fix it so that if you die, you won't _gain_ exp in any
  skills - could happen if new table is harder - 3 level loss could still
  mean having higher exp total.
common/map.c: Fix on_same_map so check to see if either object has null
  map value - prevents crashes.
MSW 2002-10-13


Experience cleanup - the main functional change is that no upper limit of 
   exp in an individual skill, save for the limit that there is an upper
   limit of total exp a player can have.  Thus, if a player concentrates
   complete in one skill, he could get to level 110 in it.  A lot of
   code cleanup was done - so much had gotten added to the exp code that it
   was a real mess.
common/living.c: re-arrange some of the code, so all the exp related
   functions are together.  remove adjust_exp(), change check_dm_add_exp_to_obj()
   to check_exp_adjust.  Add new functions add_player_exp(), check_exp_loss(),
   check_exp_add(), subtract_player_exp().
include/libproto.h: rebuilt.

configure, configure.ac: Remove --enable-old-layout option - that is more than
    3+ years old now.  Add --enable-dmalloc option so code can be compiled

    files.
common/porting.c: Add stdarg.h to list of included files.

  Fix crash when null player maps.
include/player.h: Add golem_count element to player structure.
server/player.c: Add code in handle_newscs_player() that checks status of
    golem, clears op->contr->golem is value is bogus
server/spell_effect.c, server/spell_util.c: Initialize golem_count 
    value when golem is created.
socket/request.c: Check for null map value.
MSW 2002-10-02

Mostly bugfixes, but the addition of a wiz 'hide' command which makes the
   wiz out of sight so to speak.
--
common/loader.l, common/loader.c: Fix bug where flag values were being saved
   with actual value of the flag (eg, 32768, 16, etc) instead of 1/0 value -
   Code effectively worked the same, just was a bit odd looking at save files.
include/player.h: Add hidden element to player structure.
include/sproto.h: Add command_hide(), update proto for players_on_map()
lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in: add wizhelp/hide file.
server/apply.c: Add error checking to converts so it doesn't crash if the
   converter doesn't have a proper other_arch.  Modify shopmats so that they
   don't transport spell effects, like fireballs an burning hands.
server/attack.c: Modify code so players can drain other players exp.
server/c_misc.c: Modify various functions to not show info on hidden DM.
server/c_wiz.c: Add command_hide(), clean up command_invisible() a bit.
server/commands.c: Add hide command to dispatch table.
server/main.c: Add code to not update players on map for hidden dm.
server/player.c: Give hidden dm perpetual invisiblity.
server/skills.c: Only get exp if you actually stole an item - fixes abuse
   whereby players who couldn't carry item could continually 'steal' it from 
   monster and just gain exp.
server/swap.c: modify players_on_map() to take addition arg to determine if
   real players on map should be shown, or if we shouldn't count hidden dms.
socket/info.c: Modify code so that oldsockets don't get reports on high verbose
   messages.
socket/metaserver.c: Modify metaserver update to not include hidden dms.
utils/Makefile.in: update datestmp.

   if you run this code without the updated archs, you will likely find
   many things do not work.
acinclude.m4 aclocal.m4 configure: more refinements for libpython detection.
common/button.c: Two push_button() changes - have it check for ACTIVATE_ON_
    PUSH/RELEASE to determine if the object should get activated.  Also,
    change behaviour of TIMED_GATE so that multipart timed gates work.

common/map.c:  Fix problem with ordering in check_linked() - checking
   for NO_PASS was before checks for inventory checkers, resulting in
   inventory checkers that require the player to have an item not working.
MSW 2002-09-15


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 1.4.0:

server/disease.c: Change move_disease() somehwat - before, if you were
   not susceptible to a disease, it would never run its course.  Yet you
   would still get stuck with the symptoms.  there was a case on
   metalforge where a character had a symptom with no disease, and
   had immunity, yet was still getting stuck with the symptoms.  Not sure
   if this change will help prevent that in the future or not.
include/player.h: Change item_power in player structure to be 16 bits -
   8 bit values were getting overflowed.
MSW 2002-09-14

INSTALL: Update directions with new automake method.
common/Makefile.am, common/Makefile.in: Fix code for building the libproto.h
   file - it was including loader.l and not loader.c
common/exp.c: Add init_experience() and dump_experience() functions -
   init_experience() loads the experience table from a file.  Add default
   experience table into this file
common/init.c: Add call to init_experience()
common/living.c: Remove experience tables - players can select the one they
   want by changing the exp_table file.  Remove reference to new_levels[] -
   only levels[] is used now for the formentioned reason.
include/config.h: Update notes about SIMPLE_EXP system.
include/libproto.h: rebuilt.
lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in: Add exp_table to list of files.
lib/exp_table: New file that contains experience information.
server/c_object.c: Modify command_take() to look for objects above the player
   to pick up, then objects below.  This fixes the bug with not being able
   to use the take command on items from a chest the player opens without
   moving off the space.
server/init.c: Add -mexp dump switch to dump the experience table.  Allow
   the simple experience system to be set in the settings file.
server/skill_util.c: Fix oddness in calc_skill_exp() which could result
   in add amounts of exp given.
MSW 2002-09-10


include/sproto.h: rebuilt
lib/help/killpets: New file
lib/Makefile.in: Add help/killpets file.
server/c_misc.c: Add command_kill_pets().
server/commands.c: add killpets command which kills your pets.
server/monster.c:  Add some code in check_enemy so that the enemy
    has to be a monster/generator/player to be considered valid -
    I was seeing things like arrows ending up as target enemies.
MSW 2002-09-07

More bugfixes:
common/loader.l, loader.c: Fix up the handling with speed with respect
   to style maps - the objects were still getting put on the active
   list.
common/map.c: Fix up blocked_link() to behave more like the
   blocked_two() function - inventory checkers and door handling.
   Comment out blocked_two since it isn't used anymore.  Modify
   load_objects to remove objects on style maps from the active
   list.  Remove some of the debug messages about map loading.
common/object.c: Add remove_from_active_list() function for use
   in map.c to remove objects from active list.
common/porting.c: Comment out debug message if open_and_uncompress()
   can open a file - caller of the function should print out messages,
   and it really isn't much of an error in any case.
include/libproto.h: rebuilt.
random_maps/special.c: Modify place_special_exit() - this should fix
   bug of very large treasure maps - problem was if the generated map 
   size was too small, when generate_random_map was called, it would
   generate a newly sized map that was much larger.  Code was also
   re-arranged some to make it a little more readable.
server/attack.c: Fix crash when creature may not have an owner and
   it kills something else.
server/move.c: comment added - no code change.
socket/request.c: Fix off by one error in esrv_send_animation() -
   rare condition as it only showed up when trying to send the last
   animation (zombie) - only an issue if the player is put on top of
   a zombie for some reason (no other space for them) - observed when
   leaving the random dungeon in the undead church in scorn without
   clearing out all the zombies first.

CHANGES: Update build instructions for the plugin.
random_maps/square_spiral.c: Fix bug that could cause the search
   function to go off the edge of the map looking for a clear space.
   Doesn't happen often, but one crash did happen here.
server/monster.c: Fix some bugs with monsters and wakeup - remove
    check for friendly that could never be true, and also fix
    logic so that monsters will now find the players.
MSW 2002-09-05

common/button.c:  Fix do_mood_floor() to look at all objects on space for
   something to effect, not just things above the moodfloor.
server/attack.c: Add missing check to make sure the plugin exists before
   we try to access the plugin function.
common/readlable.c: Fix crash caused by passing null value to mon_desc -
   check for non null was at end of { } do loop - check should be at the
   start.
server/monster.c: Make it so that monsters with see invisible are not
   immune to blind - monster can be given appropriate resistance to make
   it so it is not effected by blind.
MSW 2002-09-04

server/main.c: Move #endif in crypt_string to more proper place.
server/monster.c: Fix bad if statement that may have been waking up
    monsters when they shouldn't have been.
MSW 2002-09-03

This change mostly deals with improving behaviour of pet monstes.
Most of the code is from K. Reinert - however, I did some code cleanup/
fixes related to pet monsters, so it is difficult to note where
each piece of code came from.  One thing this does fix is handling of
multipart pets - these now work properly.
common/map.c: Update comment for get_rangevector() - no code change.
common/object.c: Add get_search_arr() which is used in pet monster code.
   This returns a semi random scrambling of the freearr array.
doc/Developers/protocol: Update documentation about map1a protocol command.
include/libproto.h, include/sproto.h: rebuilt.
server/attack.c: Have drain attacks return 1 damage so that it is clear
   that you are actually hitting your opponent.  Otherwise, you would
   get messages that 'you missed xyz', even though you are draining it.
   This extra point of damage shouldn't change balance in any significant
   way.
server/monster.c: Update hnadling of enemies for pet monsters. It should
   more intelligently choose the monsters and not switch/clear the
   enemy field for no reason anymore.  Change find_nearest_living_creature to
   use the get_search_arr() to more randomly choose direction of target - 
   before, there was a proclivity to always look in the north direction.
   Modify can_hit() to look for closes part of enemy - otherwise, monsters
   may not attack opponents even if they were right next to them because
   they couldn't get to the enemies head.  Remove move_object from
   this function - merged with move_ob in move.c
server/move.c:  Fix move_ob to use 'cleaner' code of move_object, but
   also have specific features that move_ob had (player handling).
   Before move_ob didn't handle multipart objects correctly, and the
   two functions were largely the same.  Now move_object() just calls
   move_ob - the only difference in the functions is that move_ob()
   takes 3 parameters instead of 2 of move_object() (added
   parameter is originator).  I think this should now mean multipart
   player objects may now work.
server/pets.c: get_pet_enemy enhanced to be much smarter about
   selecting/finding things for the pet to attack.
server/player.c: Remove commented out line of init_beforeplay
MSW 2002-08-31

server/attack.c: Modify drain attack code so that if some agent of the
player is doing the drain (eg, avatar, summoned monster, or even spell),
player gets exp added to his total.  Otherwise, the agent could suck all
the exp out of the monster, resulting in no gain for the player.
Also, fix bug in drain code where uninitialized value was being used
if enemy had 0 protection to drain.
MSW 2002-08-30

Various bugfixes:
common/map.c:  Change so that same logic is used to determine pclose/fclose
   that is used to determine popen/fopen - otherwise, compressed map
   files probably don't work properly.
common/treasure.c: Do a memset to make sure entire treasureslist is
   set to sane values.
lib/archetypes: Fix 'slaying' field (which determines spell name) in
    god_spelldirect_face_of_death and god_spelldirect_finger_of_death
server/apply.c:  Fix infinite loop if the player had cursed items
    that needed to be unapplied to apply an item - setting up next
    item iteration was inside if check when it shouldn't be.  Also,
    print message to player if this is the case.
server/monster.c: Better format some of the code for improved readability.
    Fix indentation of can_see_enemy.  Clean up invisiblity check - may
    have fixed a bug - old code should have worked, but wasn't very
    readable.
server/move.c: Fix some bad code from last checkin - didn't fix
    the crash on no floor for door type, and instead removed
    check type from next line by accident.
server/player.c: Remove call for init_beforeplay - this is already
    properly called, and re-calling it resulted in some things being
    redone when they shouldn't be.
server/skills.c: Add message if there is nothing to steal form the monster.
server/spell_effect.c: Improve message when invisiblity duration is
    maximized.
socket/init.c: change O_NDELAY to O_NONBLOCK of fcntl.
MSW 2002-08-25

doc/Developers/objects: Update with new (better) information from
   Todd Mitchell.  Doc is more complete, and now has an index which
   should make it easier to find things.
server/move.c: Fix dereferencing NULL problem - was looking at op->above,
   but op could be NULL if the map had no objects on a space (typically
   not the case, but...)  No reason I can see that we care about the object
   above - just process in normal order.
MSW 2002-08-21

server/time.c: Possible fix for bug seen on metalforge - 
   in move_player_mover, make sure we are working with the head of the
   monster.
MSW 2002-08-13

More spoiler-html fixes - was not including attacktype information, but
also fixed some formatting issues.
common/item.c: Include attacktypes in describe_monster.
doc/scripts/Makefile.in: Add monsters-extract.pl file.
doc/spoiler-html/Makefile.in: Update to use ../scripts/monster-extract.pl
   file, remove monster-extract file.
doc/spoiler-html/spoiler.html: rebuilt.
MSW 2002-08-11

Fix spoiler-html generation to show resistances.  Need to do normal spoiler
next.  Add a new docs/scripts directory to hold the common scripts,
instead of spoiler, spoiler-html, playbook, and playbook-html each having
their own copies.
configure, configure.in: Add doc/scripts directory.
doc/spoiler-html/Makefile.in: Update build directions to use 
    ../scripts/items-extract.pl
doc/spoiler-html/spoiler.html: Rebuilt with updated information.
doc/scripts/Makefile.in: Makefile for directory.
doc/scripts/items-extract.pl: perl version of the items-extract file.
doc/spoiler-html/items-extract: awk version - no longer used.
MSW 2002-08-02

common/item.c: Have describe monster show resistances of monsters - useful
   for spoiler output, as well probe spell.
server/disease.c: Fix typo.
MSW 2002-08-02

include/global.h: add FREE_AND_CLEAR_STR macro, relocate DELETE_STRING
   by the other macros.
server/c_misc.c: Fix string printout in applymode function.
server/disease.c: Update name_pl in diseases.
server/player.c: replace FREE_AND_CLEAR with FREE_AND_CLEAR_STR - was
    freeing data that shouldn't be freed.
MSW 2002-08-01

Various fixes:
INSTALL: Update with note about --with-includes configure option.
common/loader.c, common/loader.l: Add comment about flag_invis_undead
include/define.h: Add FLAG_INVIS_UNDEAD
lib/adm/map_info: Modify to not follow symbolic links.
server/monster.c: Modify can_detect_enemy to be a bit more straightforward
   in its logic.  Also, modify detection of invisible creatures - don't
   reduce duration, just return that the monster can detect the player.
   There were also spurious messages about the player being seen.
   Modify can_see_enemy to check FLAG_INVIS_UNDEAD, also fix broken
   comparison
server/player.c: Clear FLAG_INVIS_UNDEAD when invisibility ends.  Fix
   action_makes_visible() - had reverse logic on FLAG_MAKE_INVIS check,
   and a typo in the printed message.
server/spell_effect.c: cast_invisible() to use FLAG_INVIS_UNDEAD -
   also check for maximum duration, and only search active objects when
   clearing enemy.
server/weather.c: Fix off by one on comparision when intializing maps
   darkness when loading map from disk.  In dawn_to_dusk, don't do
   further processing if the light hasn't changed.
MSW 2002-07-29

 

Various bug fixes, add glyph spell:
TODO: Updated
common/map.c: Fix change_map_light() - if darkness was reduced to zero,
   it wouldn't properly notify the players or update the maps they are
   on.  Also, make it more robust to handle changes by more than one.
include/define.h: Increase NROFREALSPELLS
include/spellist.h: Add glyph spell.
include/spells.h: Add SP_GLYPH entry.
server/attack.c: Fix up kill_object() - it has had some many various
   additions that it was difficult to follow the logic.  It should also now
   do better check on skill objects when awarding experience.
server/player.c: Add some checks/addition to properly deal with freeing the
   name_pl in the player object.  Fix it so that if you are braced, you
   still won't attack friendly creatures.
server/rune.c: Add cast_generic_rune() to handle the glyph and rune spell.
server/spell_effect.c: Fix up some pointers in cast_cause_disease() -
   needed so that it works properly when embedded in a glyph.  Have it
   return 1 even if no one caught anything - you still cast the spell, so
   you should lose the grace for it.
server/spell_util.c: Fix some formatting.  Break out the code dealing
   with rune into cast_generic_rune()
socket/loop.c: Add flag to player command mapping, and update structure -
   if flag is set, command can only be issued when player is in play,
   and not when waiting at the quit or login prompt - fixes crashes where
   players could wait for the map to get swapped out (after quitting), and
   then looking at a space.
socket/request.c: Fix map2cmd so that invisible players are drawn.
MSW 2002-07-24

Add dm command 'freeze' which freezes a player from doing anything for some
amount of time.
include/sproto.h: rebuilt.
lib/Makefile.in: Add freeze to wizhelp files.
lib/wizhelp/freeze: New file.
server/c_wiz.c: Add command_freeze().  Also, break out 
   get_other_player_from_name() - several functions need the same logic
   of getting a player named X that is not us - making it a function
   reduces the duplicate code.  Fix some formatting for some functions.
server/commands.c: Add command_freeze to the dispatch table.
MSW 2002-07-17

lib/Makefile.in: add a 'archonly' directive that only collects archetypes
    and doesn't collect images.
lib/archetypes: rebuilt for fixes made to arches.
lib/collect.pl.in: modified to take second parameter -ARCHONLY, that causes
    it not to save out animation, bmaps and faces file.
server/apply.c: Change order of print when applying/unapplying - print out
    the 'you apply/unapply' before we print out the changes that applying
    the item does.  It seems odd for it to be 'you feel stronger.  you apply
    xyz'.  Fix can_apply_object() so that if a player needs to unapply
    several items, the right return code is returned and we don't say
    the player has a choice.
server/player.c: Fix missing clearing of player->next.
MSW 2002-07-15

-- Start body commit notes --
Major commit.  This adds body locations which is used for equipping items.
Equipment has information which body part it gets equipped to, and monsters
have information on how which body locations they can have.

As part of this work, I also did a lot of code cleanup.

To use this, you must use up to date archetypes - the ones included
in this commit are fine - just make sure you install them.  If
you don't, players will not be able to equip items.

common/arch.c: Initialize body_used to be same as body_info for
    archetypes - this way when monsters are created, they can
    start equipping items right away.
common/exp.c: update new_exp() - some flags it checked for before no longer
    exist or have new names.
common/info.c: describe_item() now takes second parameter - update 
    dump_abilities to use new calling convention.
common/item.c: Add table that describes the body_info locations and
    their names.  Add functions that calculate item power for objects
    that don't have it set.  Update display functions to show 
    item_power in items.  Update describe_monster() - use_horn/wand/rod
    merged into just use_range.  Modify describe_item() to take second
    paramater - who the item is being described for.  Show item_power
    in describe_item.
common/living.c: Pull out MAXLEVEL from being defined in this file -
    define in in define.h, since other files use it.  Add NUM_STATS
    define - replace hard coded values of having just 7 stats with it.
    Update change_abil to not display that the player has a new
    attacktype when equipping a bow that has it - fix_player() ignores
    the attacktype of the bow, so it was incorrect information.
    fix_player(): Initialize player ranges structure to null -
    will get filled in by code in function, updated to deal with
    updating the body_used data from body_info in the objects.
    Replace instances of last_heal with gen_sp_armour.  Rearrange
    some code to make function more readable.
common/loader.c, common/loader.l: Remove the variable_const information - no
    longer needed and confusing for new people when adding in new object
    elements.  Add set_body_info() - parses the string from the load file and
    sets the appropriate array element.  Add check_loaded_object() - does
    sanity checking for an object after finished loading - replaces need for
    long processing directive in the actual rules by having seperate function.
    Remove unused flags from load directives (apply_once, no_pretext,
    can_apply), add some new ones (item_power, gen_sp_armour), update others
    to can_use_range.  Replace flag_links with simple array that contains the
    name for each corresponding flag.  Update get_ob_diff to not use the V_
    values and just include the actual string name - all recent changes have
    done this, just updated for old stuff.  Update get_ob_diff to save new
    values that have been added.
common/object.c: clear_object:  Modify to use memset to clear
    the structure to zero - this is less error prone than listing
    all the specific values, and probably faster.  Also, makes it
    easier to add new elements - no need to update object.c in most
    cases.
common/player.c: Remove get_player_ob routine - this is now merged
    in with get_player_ob in server/player.c.  Remove generate_ext_title -
    not used.
common/readable.c: Update to pass second argument to describe_item.
common/treasure.c: Update to calculate item_power of generated items.
    Clean up a lot of code formatting.  Update add_abilities
    to use gen_sp_armour values, not last heal (note, it appears
    the last_heal values weren't being used before).  Update
    calls to describe item to take second parameter.
doc/Developers/objects: Update will_apply notes, add note about
    item_power, body location.
include/define.h: Comment out unused flags (flag_apply_once, flag_paralyzed,
    flag_no_pretext, flag_ready_rod, flag_read_horn).  Add flag_use_shield.
    rename flag_use_wand to flag_use_range.  rename flag_ready_wand to
    flag_ready_range.  Add flag_ready_scroll.  Update ARMOUR_SPELLS access
    macro.  Add AP_PRINT flag to apply flags.  Add CAN_APPLY_.. return types
    for can_apply_object function.
include/includes.h: add strftime, mktime checks to this file.
include/libproto.h: rebuilt.
include/living.h: Add NUM_STATS define, update extern declarations
    to use it for sizing.
include/loader.h: remove the V_.. info and  xbm_.. externs that were not
    used.
include/newserver.h: Remove ext_tile information.
include/object.h:  Add Body_Locations structure, NUM_BODY_LOCATIONS define.
    Add definitions for WILL_APPLY values.  Clean up object structure - 
    formatting is now consistent, ordering of values groups values
    together more logically.  Update all types to use the int8/int16/int32
    types.  Several unused fields removed.
include/player.h: Update rangetype enum.  Add unapplymode enum.
    Clean up player structure - type updates, unused fields removed, 
    formatting fixed up.
include/spells.h: remove range_name extern.  Update SpellTypeFrom 
    field to combine wand/rod/horn into spellMisc - none of the
    spell casting code was differentiating these.
include/sproto.h: rebuilt.
lib/Makefile.in: Add new help files (applymode, bind, brace)
lib/archetypes: rebuilt for body_info, gen_sp_armour, item_power,
    can_use_shield information.
lib/artifacts: updated for item_poer and gen_sp_armour changes.
lib/treasures: remove unused _force for player treasure.
plugin/plugin_python.c: Change FLAG_USE_WAND to FLAG_USE_RANGE.
server/apply.c: Move stftime, mktime to include/includes.h.  Remove
    draw_find() - one line function can just as easly be in the 
    code itself.  Update calls to long_desc to pass second parameter.
    move gravestone_text() to player.c file.  Add direction parameter to
    apply_scroll() - in this way monsters can use it properly.
    Remove dead code.  Update apply_special function.  Add
    unapply_special(), get_item_from_body_location(), unapply_for_ob(),
    and can_apply_object() functions.
server/attack.c:  Remove SET_FLAG(op, FLAG_PARALYZED) line - no code
    was ever checking status of FLAG_PARALYZED.
server/c_misc.c:  add command_body() which dumps body information for
    player.  Update who as idle element in player structure removed -
    was not being used by anything.  Add command_applymode() to 
    set players prefered unapply method.  Remove calls to unlock_player()
    in various functions - unlock_player() has not done anything
    meaningful for a while.
server/c_object.c: Modify long_desc to take a second parameter
    which is who is examing the object.  this is needed so that we
    can pass it down to some of the lower level functions.
    Update calls to describe_item to pass this second parameter.
    remove FLAG_NO_PRETEXT code - no archetyps were using it.  When
    examining objects, also tell player where to put them on.
server/c_range.c:  Update legal_range() - we now store the object that
    is responsible for a range in the player object, so code is
    much simpler.  Update change_spell() to not destroy golem
    just by readying another spell - we now let players regain control
    of golems after switching to another range.  Update change_spell
    to use item name of object for range description.
server/c_wiz.c: remove reference to count_left from player object -
    field removed from structure.
server/commands.c: add new commands (applymode, body) to command dispatch
    table.
server/login.c:  Remove unlock_player() and lock_player() and calls to it -
    current checking of names at login should be sufficient to
    prevent duplicates.  Remove dead code from check_name.  Update
    load/save code for unapply mode value.  Add set_flag(op,
    FLAG_USE_SHIELD) if player is allowed to use armor - needed since
    flag_use_shield is really a class feature and so is not automatically
    updated for old player files.
server/main.c: Remove references to count_left.  memset marker object to
    NULL - seems to increase stability on metalforge server.
server/monster.c: Many updates related to the body info - monsters follow some
    rules as players.  Add monster_should_cast_spell function - monsters will
    use this for all spellcasting related actions (abilities, scrolls, wands,
    etc).  Update for merged rod/horn/wand ranges.  Update bow use by monsters
    - they don't actually need to equip it to fire - this way we don't need to
    constantly swap the monsters weapons between the bow and melee item.  Use
    fire_bow from player.c for most of the work.  Modify scroll usage -
    monster will use it when player is near, not when it first picks it up.
    Add FLAG_READY_SCROLL to denote the monster has a scroll to use.  Also,
    monster now casts it in appropriate direciton.  Merge the
    monster_use_wand/rod/horn into monster_use_range.  Modify
    check_good_weapon and check_good_armour to just look at the stats of the
    two items without needing the monster to apply it first.
server/player.c: Print motd in green so it is more noticable.  Update
    get_player function to do work it did before as well as that of
    get_player_ob.  Have get_player take a parameter which is the object of
    the player if he has one.  Modify to use memset to clear the player
    structure - more sure fire than explicitly listing values to initialize.
    Remove calls to unlock_player.  Modify fire_bow so that monsters can also
    use the function.  Add fire_misc_object() to fire_wand/rod/horn - removes
    code from fire().  Add gravesetone_text() to this file.
server/shop.c: Update to pass second parameter to describe_item().
server/skill_util.c: Update check_skill_to_fire since there are fewer
    rangetypes now.  change range_scroll name to range_golem, as that is
    a bit more accurate for what it actually does.  Modify show_skills()
    to show player his item power and total of items he has equipped.
server/skills.c: Add second paramater to long_desc, remove references to
    count_left.
server/spell_effect.c: Add second paramater to long_desc, remove references to
    count_left. Update range_scroll to range_golem
server/spell_util.c: remove references to count_left.  Update messages
    if player trying to cast where he can't with new range names.
socket/info.c: Update range information and how we display what it is -
    we will use the object name of the range if available.  Remove
    reference last_known_spell, last_shoot, last_spell, last_value
    player structure fields.
socket/init.c: Remove ext_title information.
socket/request.c: Add element for life_stealing in the resistance array.
    Remove references to idle, count_left in player structure.  remove
    ext2 title information.

server/disease.c: Fix propogation of diseases with negative damage (these
   do a percent of the creatures damage).  The new disease was getting
   a damage rating of 1 in all cases because we were passing a negative
   value to random_roll for the top end of the range.
MSW 2002-07-08

common/arch.c: Add 'unlocked' match for item_matched_string.
lib/help/drop, lib/help/dropall: Help files for these commands.
lib/Makefile.in: Update to include help commands above.
server/spell_effect.c: Fix formatting of summon_pet() function.  Modified so
   that it no longers sucks player spellpoints when casting it via scroll -
   scrolls should not cast the player spellpoints.  No idea why that code was
   there - in fact, casting off a scroll used more sp than casting from
   memory.  Modify cast_cause_disease() function so that if the passed
   direction is 0, we refer to the facing and cast in that direction - this
   means spells of cause disease now work.  Also perform some minor formatting
   changes in the function.
TODO: Add not about inscription.
MSW 2002-07-05

common/arch.c:  Fix bug in item_matched_string which was matching all
  values (inverse in fact) when passed with count > 1 in matching
  string - missing ! operator.

  unsupported and could stop working in some future release.
MSW 2002-07-05

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 1.3.0:

socket/request.c: If players were using the original map command with
  an even map size, server would try to send too much data to client -
  checking in server would result in an abort.  Modify code to now properly
  send right number of spaces.
lib/Makefile.in: remove extraneous / in front of motd entry in file list.
include/version.h: Update for version 1.3.0
Makefile.in: Update for version 1.3.0
lib/archetypes: rebuilt.
MSW 2002-07-01

doc updates: Rebuild the doc files, but most of this is fixing some of the
doc build stuff to correctly working with the new image set naming
scheme and fixing some bugs.  Some doc is certainly out of date - the
playbook doesn't mention the classes for example.
doc/handbook.ps, doc/spoiler.ps: rebuilt
Note: all the doc/playbook changes also apply to the same files in
  doc/playbook-html.
doc/playbook/Makefile.in, doc/playbook/makeps, doc/playbook/makeps.pl:
   replace the awk makeps script with the perl one.
doc/playbook/items-extract: Don't show invisible items.
doc/playbook/levels-extract: Update so that it properly finds the declaration
   of the levels in living.c
doc/playbook/treas1-extract: Clear type when we get a new Object header.  was
   resulting in duplicate entries for the characters.
doc/playbook/treas2-extract: Don't include forces of the no_class_face_change
   as part of characters treasures
doc/playbook-html/chap1.html: Update ftp site information.
doc/spoiler/Makefile.in, doc/spoiler/makeps.pl, doc/spoiler/makeps:
     replace the awk makeps script with the perl one.
doc/spoiler/items-extract: Add a space after the name match so that it won't
   match on the name_pl field.
doc/spoiler-html/items-extract:  Add a space after the name match so that it won't
   match on the name_pl field.
doc/spoiler-html/makeps.pl: Update to handle new naming scheme for images.

server/rune.c: Fix bug that allowed players to use marking runes to create
  arbitrary objects by embedding a endmsg in the string.
MSW 2002-06-26

lib/ban_file: Update comments to describe how it actually works.
server/commands.c: Add some time cost to shout, say, and tell commands.  This
   prevents abusive players from issuing huge number of these commands.
MSW 2002-06-20

doc/playbook-html/Makefile.in: Remove some superfluous blank lines
   in the file.
configure, configure.in, plugin/Makefile.in: Modify configure script to
   subtitute PLUGIN_TARGET, have plugin/Makefile not build/install
   plugin if necessary support libraries are not in place.
common/item.c, include/material.h: Move the declaration/initialization
  of materialtype from material.h to item.c
server/main.c: Modify crypt_string so that on Freebsd systems, it will
  use des_crypt if available, if not, won't encrypt.
MSW 2002-06-18

TODO: Additional updates.
Add support for loading the EMERGENCY_.. locations from a .emergency file in
the map directory.  This makes it easy to switch map distributions without the
need to recompile.  The emergency information is now stored in the settings
structure.
common/init.c: add EMERGENCY_  defines to default values in setting.  Add
  init_emergency_mappath which loads the information.
include/config.h: Remove NEW_WORLD_MAP definition, as it is no longer
  needed.  Update some of the EMERGENCY_.. information as we don't need
  to include the information for the new world map.
include/global.h: Add emergency_.. fields to settings structure.
server/login.c, server/main.c, server/player.c: Update references from
  the EMERGENCY.. values to settings.emergency values.
MSW 2002-06-15

lib/Makefile.in: modified so that it doesn't overwrite commonly customized
   files (eg, motd, dm_file, ban_file).  These files will get installed 
   on new installations.
MSW 2002-06-14

common/item.c: break out monster description into describe_monster
   function from describe_item - the later was a really long function.
   Reveal weapon speed for identified weapons, spell point regen
   penalty and max speed for identified armor - this was discussed about
   6 weeks ago.  Clean up the code to reduce the number of redundant
   if statements and otherwise confusing code in describe_item.
MSW 2002-06-14

configure.in, configure, plugin/Makefile, plugin/Makefile.in,
   plugin/Makefile.old:  Modify the plugin module to gets its needed
   information from configure.  configure.in modified to look for Python.h and
   to find the python library.  plugin/Makefile.in is a new file.
   plugin/Makefile.old is the old plugin/Makefile (removed) - may be useful
   for sites where configure does not work for some reason.  The use of
   --with-includes=-I/usr/include/python2.2 (or the like) will likely be
   needed for configure to find the Python.h file.  Note - if you
   are doing a CVS update, you will need to re-run configure with the
   appropriate options for this change to take effect.
MSW 2002-06-13

server/main.c:  If on freebsd system, don't crypt the password. 
Crypt on freebsd behaves diferently, and since there is little reason
to encrypt passwords, easier to just leave them decrypted.
Fix for sourceforge bug 469017
MSW 2002-06-13

More minor changes, including a fix for the disappearing object bug -
this was caused by the flag_links not getting updated the last
time new flags were added.  Problem probably only showed up now
because loader.c wasn't rebuilt until recent changes.
--
common/loader.c, common/loader.l: add extern to arch_init, when
  loading and get an object from a file, complain and ignore it if
  arch_init is not set (only time we should get object (vs arch) for
  names is when we load the archetypes file).  Add missing entries
  to flag_links array.
common/treasure.c: Fix code so that proper plural names are generated
  for custom items (potions, flesh items, etc).
include/define.h: Add note about updating flag_links when NUM_FLAGS is
  increased.
server/skills.c: don't let players steal from players with FLAG_WIZ set.
MSW 2002-06-09

Mostly bugfixes.  I'm not sure if this will fix the disappearing arch problem-
none of the changes made in the original multiple name would seem to 
cause it, so hard to say if any of these changes may fix it.
--
common/arch.c:  Change get_archetype_by_name to be more efficient and
   not leak memory.  Modify code that frees all archetype data to free
   the name_pl information.  Make sure the clone.name_pl is set to
   NULL.  When singularites are created, set the name_pl for them.
common/loader.l, common/loader.c: Modify code that fixes up name_pl
   to be more correct when it fixes up name_pl for old objects.
common/map.c: Modify load_map_header so that tile_paths will be normalized -
   need for editor to be able to load maps that have a multipart object
   that spans the maps.
crossedit/Edit.c: Modify some calls of out_of_map to OUT_OF_REAL_MAP, since
   tiling code really isn't fully in place for the editor.  Modify
   EditPerformFill so that it actually works and doesn't crash the editor.
include/global.h: Move FREE_AND_COPY macro from loader.l to here so that
   all source code files can use it.
lib/adm/map_info: Modify to actually be able to examine just a sub
   portion of the map directories, and not all of them.  Don't always
   show the unused objects - information isn't very interesting if only
   a portion is being examined.  Modify the exit examining code to properly
   deal with random maps (if there is a finalmap component, make sure
   that does exist.)  Loade the bmaps file and not the faces file to
   find valid faces.
plugin/plugin_python.c: Add missing %s that described what script
   was actually loaded.
random_maps/special.c, server/alchemy.c, server/c_misc.c, server/gods.c,
   server/login.c, server/player.c, server/spell_effect.c: Set up proper
    name_pl value for code that changes the name of objects.
server/apply.c: Use FREE_AND_COPY to set up names.  Set up proper
   name_pl values for cases that change name.  In apply_lighter, call fix_player
   if player is lighting an object in his inventory - necessary for the
   players glow_radius to get updated so the change actually takes effect.
socket/request.c: Modify esrv_map_scroll so that it properly clears cells
   that are moving out of view - failure to do this was resulting in the
   map1a updating these spaces with empty faces.  This was causing
   fog of war wackiness with the client.

common/button.c: Fix mood floor code - before, it was changing the moods
   of all sorts of objects (luggage, itself, etc).  Now, it only
   changes objects above the floor, and only monsters.
MSW 2002-05-31


Main change is the addition of name_pl and client_type to object
structure.  The name_pl contains the proper plural name instance - fixes
problem of '2 tooths'.  client_type is sent to the client so that client
doesn't need to figure out sorting on its own.  Client_type is an object
attribute, so can be modified in maps to hide the real type.
--
common/arch.c: item_matched_string() modified to use the name_pl field
   when trying to match names, and not to try to make the name plural
   itself. 
common/item.c: query_short_name(),query_base_name() modified to
    use name_pl instead of trying to make the name plural.
common/loader.c, common/loader.l:  Add code to load and save the name_pl
    value and client_type.  Add logic when object is finished loading
    to set name_pl value to same as name or arch name if no name_pl
    is specified - this supports old maps/characters in which the objects
    dont have a name_pl field yet.  Disable logic for need_an and need_ie
    flags since they are no longer needed.  Fix bug that caused
    elevation not to get saved.
common/object.c: Add client_type check for CAN_MERGE function.  Add
    appropriate logice in functions to handle setting, clearing, and
    copying of name_pl values.  Remove unused anim_... fields
    initialization.
doc/Developers/objects: Add information about the name_pl field and
    client_type.
doc/Developers/protocol: Remove item protocol command info - it has
    been obsoleted.  Add information about item2 protocol command.
include/define.h:  Remote ST1_* values - they were not being used.
    comment out FLAG_AN and FLAG_NEED_IE values.
include/newserver.h: Add itemcmd to socket structure - this is the
    version of the item protocol command that will be sent to the client.
include/object.h: Add name_pl and client_type field to object structure.
    Remove unused anim_* values.
lib/archetypes: rebuilt with new archetypes that contain client_type
    and name_pl information.
lib/bmaps, lib/bmaps.paths, lib/crossfire.1, lib/crossfire.0, lib/faces:
    rebuilt.
server/monster.c: Remove anim_ references that were not being used.
socket/init.c: Initialize itemcmd version in the socket to 1.
socket/item.c: Remove special handling for clients of old versions - all
    clients now have to be at least sc_version 1024 (which has been around for
    a long time).  This simplifies a lot of the object code that deals with
    sending or not sending plural names to the client - now always send them.
    Change code that sends item to client to use the item revision (currently
    1 or 2) that the client wants.  If version 2, send along client_type
    information.
socket/request.c: Handle 'itemcmd' parameter in setup command.  Make
    sure it is in proper range.  If client is very old (sc_version < 1024)
    tell them so.
MSW 2002-05-30


crossedit/png.c, crossedit/xutil.c: Increase size of temporary buffers that
  are used when loading images - necessary to allow the editor to run without
  crashing.
include/newserver.h: Remove quick_pos from the MapCell structure.
server/main.c: Add code to set the coordinates to the EMERGENCY_X/Y
  values if using the EMERGENCY_MAP.
socket/request.c: Fix code that was causing darkness to get repeatedly
  sent for some spaces.
MSW 2002-05-19 

The bulk of this commit is to modify the server to only send the lower
rightmost part of multipart archetypes that use the same head.  This allows
support of big images in the client.

common/arch.c: Modify first_arch_pass to figure out the tail_x/y values for
  multipart archs.  Rename the prev variable to head, as that it really what
  it is.  Remove quick_pos info.
common/object.c: remove quick_pos info from object.
doc/Developers/images: Add notes about using merged images.
doc/Developers/protocol: Add information about the map1a command, which
  is used to for big image support.  Remove map2 documentation.
include/map.h: Add MAP_LAYERS define instead of using hardcoded value of 3.
include/newserver.h:  Change the MapCell to use MAP_LAYERS - saves
  considerable memory.  Add defines for MAX_CLIENT_ map sizes.
  Remove map1cmd, map2cmd elements from socket structure - instead use enumeration
  of mapmode - only one map type will be used at any time by the client, so
  no reason to have individual elements - it also makes it easier to add new
  mapmode commands.
include/object.h: remove quick_pos, update_tag from object structure.
  Add tail_x, tail_y values to archetype structure.
include/player.h: Remove some now unused values from the player structure
  (drawn, floor, floor2, darkmask).  These have been superseded by the 
   map cells in the socket structure for quite a while.
include/sockproto.h: rebuilt
server/player.c: Remove code that initialized the drawn values in the player
  structure since they no longer exist.
socket/init.c: Replace map1cmd, map2cmd elements in socket structure with
  mapmode element.  Modify init_ericserver so that it properly passes an
  int when setting the SO_REUSERADDR field.
socket/request.c: Modify code in SetUp function to use the new mapmode
  enumeration in the socket structure.  Add support for map1acmd setup
  option.  Throughout map code, replace MAXMAPCELLFACES with MAP_LAYERS.
  modify map_clearcell to take options for values to clear the cell to.
  Add have_head, check_head, and update_space commands - used with the
  map1 command to store and find head information.
  draw_client_map1 modified to support map1a extensions, as well as added
  logic for checking for heads in blocked and out of viewable map spaces.
  Some of the code is simplified by using the update_space function, since
  the logic for processing each layer was otherwise the same.  remove
  draw_client_map2 function.  esrv_map_scroll has same logic - some
  variables and code formatting changes.

server/login.c, server/c_misc.c: Don't save characters with 0 experience.
This apparantly fixes some abuses.  MSW 2002-05-18

server/attack.c: Don't generate PLAYER_KILL_PLAYER messages if kill
happened on battleground.  Also, datestamp the messages.
MSW 2002-05-13

server/attack.c: Generate log message when a player kills another player -
include the ip address of the killer to make it easier to add them to
ban files. MSW 2002-05-06

Changes for 1.2.0:
Makefile.in, include/version.h: Update for 1.2.0 release
lib/Makefile.in: have it make an archive for the archetypes.
MSW 2002-04-28


doc/Developers/protocol: Add documentation about the map2 protocol command.
socket/request.c: Fix bad indentation for the map2 function.  No actual
   functional code changes, but some comments updated.  Running diff with the
   -w option will make the changes, or lack thereof, more viewable.
MSW 2002-04-28

crossedit/xutil.c: Update to use name of png file.
lib/archetypes: collected - pl_dragon arch changed a while back, with no
    new collect.
lib/collect.pl.in: Add some notes about usage if no option is given or
    if --help is given.
server/gods.c: Fix that resulted in weapon/armor restrictions not working.
MSW 2002-04-23

Various minor bugfixes.  Note the changes may appear larger than they
really are due to formatting/indentation changes.  Run diff -w to
supress those:
make_win32/installwin32.bat: Update for new image files.
server/c_object.c: Fix SAVE_INTERVAL #ifdef block.  It failed to compile
    as it was written.  Simplify code, but it should have the same effect.
server/move.c: Modify push_object so that if a player swaps position 
    with his pet, we send a esrv_map_scroll.  This should save bandwidth,
    and also prevents display corruption when fog of war on the client
    is in use.  Add some new comments, adjust some formatting.
server/player.c: Fix minor typo in comment.
server/skills.c: Modify new_draw_info that is responsible for the
    "You pray" messages to not have the NDI_UNIQUE flag so that
    they can get batched up, depending on users value of output-count
server/swap.c: Remove swapped out per player unique maps from the list
    of maps.  Reduces cpu and memory consumption by a minor amount, and
    results in a cleaner 'maps command output.
server/weather.c: Add standard crossfire banner to top of file.
    Modify long long declartion to just be a long.
MSW 2002-04-20

socket/item.c: Add checks to esrv_move_object - before it just trusted
the client that the destination target to move items into was a container.
Now do valid checking that the object can be picked up, that the container
can hold it, etc.  MSW 2002-04-18

Add utils/crossloop.web.in script.  This script is used on metalforge -
   it generates the backtrace file, compresses the core, and sends out
   mail.
configure.in, configure: Rebuilt to make the crossloop.web script.
utils/Makefile.in: Install the crossloop.web script.  Include the
   crossloop.web.in script when making the archive.
utils/crossloop.web.in: New file.
MSW 2002-04-14

Update to improve image caching and faceset support in the client.
    The main change is adding the 'requestinfo image_info' and
    'requestinfo image_sums' commands.
common/image.c: Checksum the bmaps file when we load it - we send this as
    part of the image_info data.
doc/Developers/protocol: Document the requestinfo data.
include/global.h: Add extern for bmaps_checksum, and the define for
    ROTATE_RIGHT which is used for checksumming.
include/newserver.h: Update SC version to 1027 so that clients can
    know if they can issue requestinfo commands.
include/sockproto.h: rebuilt
lib/adm/collect_images.pl: Add support for it to make a crossfire-images
    distribution that the client can use to bootstrap its image set.
socket/image.c: Change SendFaceCmd to take a NewSocket parameter instead
    of a player parameter - in this way, it can be used before the
    AddMe command - this allows the client to download images before
    issuing that command.  Add send_image_info and send_image_sums
    function which send the requestinfo data to the client.
socket/loop.c: Move the askface command from the player commands to the
    newsocket commands.  Add RequestInfo functino that determines the
    type of request and calls the specific function to deal with it.
MSW 2002-03-25

Changes for 1.1.0:

Updates for 1.1.0 release - pretty much all minor bug fixes, like
compiler warning messages, invalid ANSI C constructs, missing files to
include in the distribution.
Makefile.in, include/version.h: update version.
include/Makefile.in: Add some missing files
include/libproto.h, sproto.h: rebuilt to prevent compiler warnings
lib/Makefile.in: Include the wizhelp files in the archive.
server/apply.c, server/skill_util.c: fix invalid code (function parameter
    names can't match structs/typedefs), add a missing return value.
server/c_move.c, server/c_new.c, server/c_object.c, server/commands.c,
    server/daemon.c: Don't include the sproto.h if CEXTRACT is defined.
server/plugins.c: fix printf command that was printing wrong value type.
doc/spoiler-html/Makefile.in: Remove extraneous newline

server/player.c: modify play_again to remove the player object if not done so
already.  This fixes a crash observed on metalforge when a player quit at the
roll/swap stats prompt (undocumented that you can use 'q' then to do so).  It
looks like this should also fix crashes that may be associated with the kick
and shutdown wiz commands.

lib/collect.pl.in: Modified so that it uses the image.base.xyz.png to make
sure each listed face in objects has an image, and not the old xbm images
for that task.  Also, ignore all files that end in .png, .xpm, or the
face extension - consider them legitimate files for the arch directory.
MSW 2002-02-25

socket/image.c: Change type of image data to be uint8 from char.  Checksums
were being incorrectly calculated when using the char type.  MSW 2002-02-25

server/main.c: If exit is damned, update players death & WoR home-position
    and delete town portal.
server/apply.c: Fix bug in move_apply. return was used instead of goto
    leave, so recursion_depth wasn't decremented.
mids 02/13/2002

server/spell_effect.c: Fix bug in summon_cult_monster that would result
in crash if monster was killed when inserted.  MSW 2002-02-10

common/map.c: load_map_header: If the map message is empty, don't copy
    uninitialized data as the message.  This fixes various crashes.
lib/Makefile.in: Remove the adm/*xpm* utilities, as they are no longer
    needed or distributed.
server/apply.c: set the player speed to zero after they use a savebed.
    Fixes crashes with players that have constant image animation (fireborns)
    when they apply the savebed and the map then gets swapped out.
server/plugins.c: Fix some serious memory leaks.  Some still remain, with
    my comments included.
server/skills.c: Removed unused variable.
MSW 2002-02-05

include/player.h include/sproto.h server/c_chat.c server/player.c:
   New player command 'reply', replies to the last person who told you
   something.
server/c_wiz.c: New DM command 'teleport', lets a DM teleport next
   to target player, it is an inverse summon.
server/commands.c: Add hooks for 'reply' and 'teleport'.

TODO: updated with bugs, remove things that have been done and are no
  longer TODO's.
configure.in, configure: Remove lib/xpmtopix.pl file form those to be
  built, as that file has been removed.
common/object.c: Fix bug in check_walk_on which would result in spell
  objects not being properly processed - the intention is not to process
  spell objects - we should stop going up (in previous loop) when we
  get such an object, not on the way down.  This fixes directors not 
  working really well.
MSW 2001-01-13

Add the concept of overlay maps to the code.  An overlay map is a map which
is loaded on top of another map, replacing values in the header, and placing
objects on top of other objects.  This is the fundamental part of the new
weather code, but also can be used to allow dynamic editing of the worldmaps
by DM's eventually.
garbled 2002-01-01

server/spell_effect.c: fix animate_bomb so that if the bomb is in a container,
  it does not crash the server - the problem was that it was calling
  drop, which would then drop it right back into the container.  also, the
  x and y coordinates were not being properly set.
MSW 2001-12-31

This change lets the server have multiple image sets.  The client
can then request which image set to use, and the server will use
that image set, falling back to other sets as necessary.  I have tested
this with CVS client, and works fine at least in terms of old functionality.
=
doc/Makefile.in: Add images file which describes image guideline.
doc/Protocol: Various updates - some things missing, added other notes
    about facesets.
doc/images: New file, describes guidelines for image sets, as well
    as some of the internals
include/newserver.h: Update for multiple image set - redid most of the
    image definitions as they were out of date with only png being supported.
include/sockproto.h: rebuilt
lib/Makefile.in: remove crossfire.png, add crossfire.0, crossfire.0.  Update
    build directions to use crossfire.0 instead of crossfire.png
lib/adm/collect_images.pl: Modified to collect all the image sets, remove
    support for collect xpm and xbm images.
lib/crossfire.0: new file, base images
lib/crossfire.1: new file, alternate images
lib/image_info: New file, describes image sets.
lib/crossfire.png, lib/xpmtopix.pl.in: Removed - no longer needed.
socket/Makefile.in: add image.c file.
socket/image.c: Moved all image related data in this file - this includes
    loading the image files, as well as the protocol commands.
socket/init.c: move read_client_images to image.c file.  set ns->faceset
    and ns->facecache to 0.  Move freeing of image data to image.c
socket/request.c: fixed some indentation inconsistencies.add setup commands
    for faceset as facecache.  Move SetFaceMode,SendFaceCmd,esrv_send_face
    to image.c file.
MSW 2001-12-31

common/loader.l, common/loader.c, common/object.c, include/object.h,
   socket/item.c:
   Remove sub_type and sub_type2 information -
   these were poorly named fields and not properly implemented.
common/treasure.c: Add missing return type to change_treasure function.
crossedit/Edit.c: Add SET_MAP_FLAGS macro to set P_NEED_UPDATE flag
   before calling update_position.
include/config.h: Add NEW_WORLD_MAP selection which results in proper
   emergency save paths if you are using the maps-bigworld distribution.
server/c_wiz.c: Fix the formatting (indentation) of the command_create
   function.  No actual changes in how it runs, but the old
   formatting was really terrible and inconsistent.
server/main.c: remove call to send_mapstats_cmd
server/monster.c: Update the comment style to be proper, as well
   as the comments themselves.
socket/request.c: Fix up improper indentation in esrv_update_stats.
   remove send_mapstats_cmd function.
MSW 2001-12-23

Lots of changes here.  Basically implement a night and day system, as
well as tracking of game time.  A clockdata file is now created and
updated by the server to increment time.  Time increases by 1 hour,
approximately every 2 minutes of real time.  Right now this code has
virtually no effect, but as maps are updated with outdoor settings,
nightfall will occur automatically.  The time command has been modified
to show the current game time, and the clock objects have been changed to
show the game time as well.

common/map.c: Fix some bugs relating to map tiling.  MSW 2001-12-16

common/object.c random_maps/Makefile.in 
  server/c_wiz.c server/player.c server/plugins.c server/timers.c 
  socket/request.c: Most of the changes are to just fix compiling warnings
  or errors so that it compiles on sparc solaris with the workshop
  compiler (things like }; should just be }).  Declaration for alphasort
  was missing in plugins.c.  random_maps/Makefile.in had the wrong order in
  linking - the system library needs to be linked in after the crossfire
  libraries.
crossedit/App.c: Fix for running on 8 bit color - colormap was not being
  initialized to usuable default value.
crossedit/xutil.c: Broken code when duplicating faces for undefined
  images.  That code should never really be used, as pixmaps currently
  are always contiguous.
MSW 2001-12-15


Include mapstats cmd for extended clients (sdl iso). Cmd is needed for automaps
    ambient media infos, map name and map parameter infos. Paramter infos are used
    for "fire & forget" animation tags inside the map2 cmd (next patch).
server/main.c: include a automatic mapstats cmd every time the player enters a new map.
    Its the "default" mapenter cmd. The script event should used for special cases.
include/sockproto.h and socket/request.c: include the mapstats cmd function.               
MT 2001-12-03

This checkin for the most part removes support for xpm and xbm graphics - 
    now the only image supported is the png.
common/arch.c: comment out printing on warning of object having no type -
    getting 300 meaningless messages at startup is annoying.
common/image.c: Remove X11 color information from colorname array.  Remove
    processing of color_fg and color_bg information from face file - only
    use color_fg if no magicmap information is available - foreground
    and background infoformation was only needed for bitmap graphics.
common/loader.c, loader.l: Add elevation element, comment out some logging
    messages that are excessive and only really relevant for people 
    who want to fix them (really should be in the collect script
    anyways).  Remove some unused code.
common/map.c: add outdoor field to map structure - add support for loading
    and saving it.
crossedit/App.c,crossedit/CrUtil.c, crossedit/Defines.h, crossedit/crossedit.c
    crossedit/xutil.c: Remove support for non png graphics.
crossedit/Attr.c: Add support for elevation variable, remove code for non
    png graphics.
doc/map-technical: Add note about outdoor field.
include/face.h: remove fg, bg fields from face struecture.
include/global.h: Update colorname array definition.
include/loader.h: Add V_ELEVATION field.
include/map.h: Add outdoor field to map structure.
include/newserver.h: Update types so it only loads/knows about png information.
include/object.h: Add elevation field to object structure.
lib/Makefile.in: Remove support for building crossfire.xpm and crossfire.xbm
    files.
lib/animations, lib/archetypes, lib/bmaps, lib/bmaps.paths, lib/crossfire.png,
    lib/faces: Rebuilt.  Main difference is a few sea types, and the fact
    that it hadn't been collected for a while.
server/spell_effect.c: Modify dimension door so that it calls MapNewmapCmd
    so that fog of war does not get confused.  Also, removes call to
    draw as functions further up will do that.
server/spell_util.c: Remove color information from attack information that
    shuffle_attack uses.
socket/init.c, socket/request.c: Remove support for non png images.

Various minor bugfixes - 
common/loader.c: rebuilt
include/map.h: Change width,height,enter_x,enter_y to be 16 bit instead

lib/treasures: change skull treasure to tooth instead of skull_tooth since
   the later is not currently in the distributed archetypes file
server/monster.c: Optimize some code, remove some other that is not used.
server/plugins.c: Fix un initialized value in initPlugins that would
   cause crash at startup if plugin directory does not exist.
MSW 2001-11-13

common/object.c: Modify copy_owner so that if a player is passed in
   as the object to copy, we properly set that player as the owner of the
   object instead of returning.  This fixes the lack of exp when poison
   inflicted from a weapon kills something.  MSW 2001-11-05

common/map.c: Fix bug in get_rangevector which was causing reverse
 of documented procedure.  This also resulted in monsters not attacking
 adjacent creatures with physical attacks.  MSW 2001-11-03

Add weapontypes to the game.  These are currently used for nothing other
than messages, which are not fully written yet. Players should not see them

Fix a bug in the PLUGIN code where current_weapon wasn't set when the
player loaded from savefile.
Take the setting of current_weapon out of #ifdef PLUGIN

server/spell_util.c: Add out_of_map check to can_see_monsterP.  Fixes
  crash when casting ball lightning/divine shock (and likely other events)
  on maps not surrounded by walls.  MSW 2001-10-07

New attacktype messages for damage.  Now it gives you the message for the
damage type you actually did.  So if you are attacking with stormbringer,
you get electrical or drain-based messages.  Also added special messages for
the attack-based skills like punching, karate, etc.

common/map.c: Add INS_ON_TOP flag to insert_ob_in_map calls to preserve
   stacking order.  Modify update_position to generate map spaces with
   more proper order.
common/object.c: Modify insert_ob_in_map so that it preserves stacking
   if INS_ON_TOP is set.
crossedit/CrEdit.c: Add missing code that would draw third face on a space.
include/object.h: Add INS_ON_TOP flag/define.
random_maps/exit.c: Modify code so that if the random maps leading to
   a special map are reset, they will properly link in with an already loaded
   final map (and update exit from final map back up) as needed.  Also fix
   bug in that if the final map has been reset, a new one will now be properly
   loaded.
random_maps/random_map.c:Update minimum size to be 7 (up from 6) - fixes
   bug which caused crashes when square_spiral maps of 6x6 would fail to
   generate.
random_maps/random_map.h,random_maps/room_gen_onion.c: move OPT_values from
   room_gen_onion to random_map.h since the square_spiral code uses them.
random_maps/square_spiral.c: Update call to map_gen_onion to use
   OPT_.. values instead of constant integer.
random_maps/treasure.c: Add some casts to sprintf statements to eliminate
   some compiler warnings.
server/main.c: Modify enter_exit code such that a random map has
   reset, we generate a new random map.  This can happen when the random_map
   resets before the map that leads to them resets.

Add a new command category called communications commands.  Place tell, 
shout and say in here.  Also create emotion functions.  These functions 
have no real effect on the game, but make communications between players 
more colorful and fun.  They are mostly fluff.  Included with this patch 
are two new convenience functions, new_info_map_except, and 
new_info_map_except2, which allow the programmer to write to an entire 
map, except for certain individuals.

Add complete processing code for luck.  This new code removes all 
previous instances of luck, and adds a few new convenience utilities.  
Now, every die roll in the game is affected by luck in some small way.  
This causes luck to be an intangible benefit to the player, without 
totally unbalancing the game.  The new functions are random_roll, 
die_roll, and rndm, which should be used in place of RANDOM() whenever
possible.

This checkin mainly fixes multipart teleporters - they should now
work properly.  Also a minor fix to make the new pickup code work.
server/apply.c: apply_shop_mat rewritten to be more 'presentable'.
    Minor changes were needed in any case to pass the player/creature
    a a second object to teleport.
server/c_object.c: change the sscanf to be unsigned when getting value
    for new pickup mode.  At least on my system, if the value in the
    string was larger than the max signed value, sscanf set it to the 
    max value.
server/move.c: teleport function largely re-written.  Instead of the
    third arg being the 'originator', it is now the object to teleport.
    This allows the head of the teleporter to get passed to this function
    even if the object to teleport is not on the head.
server/time.c: move_teleporter modified to also check for objects on the
    other parts of multipart teleporters.  Also, pass the head object
    to the teleport function so that proper destination is used.
MSW 2001-09-02

Add Nils Lohner patch that new selections to the pickup mode.

include/define.h: Pickup type defines added.
include/player.h: Change mode (pickup mode) to 32 bits.
server/c_object.c: command_pickup function modified to support all
    the new pickup options.
server/player.c: Fix for path_to_player to prevent crashes.  Add check
    in move_player_attack just in case.  check_pick function modified to
    support new pickup options.  do_some_living modified to eat flesh
    items if player is starving and they don't have any food.
server/spell_effect.c: cast_detection modified so that detect magic/curse
    will not show objects beneath the floor.  Change so that detect_monster
    and detect_evil spells copy the face of what they detected - gives better
    appearance on client.
socket/item.c: fix bug LookAt that ws checking blocked_los on wrong
    offset.
MSW 2001-08-28

Enhancements to make monsters 'do the right thing' with relation
to tiled maps (ie, will detect players and attack them if on an adjoining
tiled maps).  This involved a rewrite of path_to_player - I've tested this
out, and if anything, it seems that monsters may be more aggressive on
spellcasting.
++
common/map.c: blocked modify to make sure it is checking valid coordinate
   value.  blocked_link,blocked_two modified to translate for tiled maps.
   Add load_and_link_tiled_map which loads a tiled map and links in all
   pointers relative to adjoining maps.  out_of_map modified to use
   this function instead of doing the work itself.  Add get_rangevector
   function that returns offset, direction, and distance between two
   objects, taking into account tiled maps.  get_rangevector_from_mapcoord
   added which is similar to get_rangevector, but takes a map and coordinates
   instead of a second object.  on_same_map function added which returns
   true if the two objects are on the same logical (ie tiled) maps.
doc/crossfire.doc: Add note about what Int does for monsters.
include/map.h: Add some comments, and add structure for rangevector
   function return values.
server/attack.c: add calls to on_same_map instead of doing op->map
   comparisons.
server/monster.c: Many functions modified to properly handle tiled
   maps properly.
server/pets.c: get_pet_enemy modified to know about tiled maps.
server/player.c: get_nearest_player modified to know about tiled maps.
   path_to_player rewritten to know about tiled maps - I think some other 
   bugs were also fixed in return values.  Split player_attack_door
   from move_player attack to keep functions a more reasonable size.
   move_player_attack, player_can_view modified to know about tiled
   maps.
server/skills.c: can detect_enemy modified to take another parameter -
   call in steal updated to pass this parameter.
server/spell_util.c: ok_to_put_more, can_see_monsterP modified to
   handle tiled maps properly.
socket/item.c: look_at modified to return proper results when player
   looks at something on an adjoining tiled map.
++ End of checkin

common/object.c:decrease_ob_nr modified to correctly update client when
    player uses item from container that is on the ground (bookshelf for
    example)
server/time.c: move_teleporter modified to skip over wall/floors and
    teleport whatever is above them.
MSW 2001-08-05

common/map.c: modify link_multipart_objects to preserve name and title of
    head when making the more parts.  modify update_position so that it should
    never show an invisible face to the player.
common/object.c: fix check_walk_on so that spells will now properly get
    affected by spinners and directories.
include/sockproto.h: Rebuilt to include MapNewmapCmd
server/hiscore.c: Fix crash if player savebeds map on map which does not
    have a name.  Use the path instead.
server/move.c: modify teleporter function to send MapNewmapCmd to client
    if player got teleported.  Needed for fog of war code.
server/time.c: modify move_teleporter so that it will not teleport walls.
socket/Makefile.in: Modified to use cproto to generate proto files.

common/object.c: insert_ob_in_map - was passing wrong value to check_walk_on,
    resulting in some things not working as expected.
doc/Protocol: Clarify how the sending of the version command works.
server/move.c: move_ob redone.  It should hopefully be more efficient (only'
    remove objects after verifying they can in fact move).  IMO, code is
    also simpler, and hopefully has fewer bugs.
socket/init.c: InitConnection - modified to set faces_sent[0] to one
    so that we will never send any information about face 0 to the client.
    facecode 0 is sent in the map1 command to clear spaces/layers.
MSW 2001-07-30

Added support for the newmap cmd needed for the fog_of_war code
in the gtk client. 
include/newserver.h: added newmapcmd:1 to NewSocket struct
server/main.c: added call to MapNewmapCmd in enter_map()
socket/init.c: init code for new newmapcmd value in NewSocket
socket/request.c: deal with "newmapcmd" value in client setup string

common/object.c: remove_ob - set P_NEED_UPDATE before calling update_position
to prevent warnings from update_position being called with P_NEED_UPDATE
being set.  MSW 2001-07-19

socket/request.c: Fix bug in map1 command which resulted in it sending
too much data with even maps.  For example, if the client requested
a 16x16 map, the server would effectively send a 17x17 map to the client.
MSW 2001-07-19

+++
Major redo of map code:
1) Remove encounter map support (with the much better random map code,
   I don't see much reason for it)
2) Remove map_ob from map structure, and instead store relevant information
   in map structure itself.  Remove strange meanings (stand_still meaning
   fixed reset time for example)
3) Redo internal structure of map and how information on each space was
   stored - this should make future extensions much easier, as well
   as making debugging easier.
4) Make USE_LIGHTING standard part of game.
5) Redo how lighting objects are handled - instead of making a linked list
   of the light giving objects, at field to mapspace that contains
   lightsource for the space.
6) Rewrite insert_ob_in_map to take optional parameter that determines
   other behaviour.  This replaces insert_ob_in_map_simple.
   Function now does sorting of some objects, so performance for lots of
   spell objects on one space should be much better.
7) Change how multipart objects are saved.  Now only save the head, and
   link in the rest of the parts when map is loaded.  Additional parts
   linked in are put just above floor level when linked in, so things like
   shops won't hide items that someone drops on them.  For monsters, this
   linking shouldn't be a problem - once they start moving, they will get
   relinked as normal (on top).
8) Modify update_object to only call update_position when necessary
   (ie, space attributes change).  Otherwise, let the map transmission
   code call update_position when necessary (ie, in players view) - this
   saves cpu time as time will not be spent updating spaces that no one
   will see (before, how the space looks was updated whenever a space
   had an object added or removed).

TODO: remove some things that have now been done.
common/Makefile.in: Remove ltostr.c and sqrt.c from list of files
common/ltostr.c, common/sqrt.c: Moved into porting.c
common/anim.c, common/button.c, common/item.c: Update calls to update_object
common/living.c: have fix_player calculate light value for player/monster.
common/logger.c: Remove code that has server exit if too many LOG messages
    happen too quickly.  This was not a reliable mechanism, and it should
    really be up to the functions doing the logging to know if they can
    continue or not.
common/los.c: Changes on how it deals with lighting on maps - get light
    value from map space array instead of using the linked list.  Functions
    that managed the light list have been removed.  Change logic of
    line of sight function to be more efficient (before, we may examine
    the same space multiple times).  rename update_all_los to
    update_all_map_los, and change update_all_los to take coordinates
    so that we only have clients within view of the change recalculate
    los.  Also, have update_all_los check for tiled maps that may have
    clients that need to get updated.
common/map.c: remove refresh_map - this used to be used to try to recover
   from map errors if many_cores was not set - IMO better to core and
   just restart and really fix the error than try to deal with possible
   corruption that may otherwise result.
   Move open_and_uncompress and close_and_delete functions to porting.c -
   they are 'common' functions that are not related to the map code.
   Remove some lighting related code, as that is no longer done with
   a list.  Many modifications because of new map structure.  And
   logic to load and save the new map structure format.  Modify
   many of the functions to take map tiling into account.  Change
   way multipart objects are saved, and add logic to relink objects
   when maps are loaded up.  Remove some functions that are only
   used by the editor into the editor.  Move update_position from
   object.c to map.c as it is better placed in map.c.  Modify
   function to figure out light for a space.  Make out_of_map a
   function that knows about map tiling.  New function - get_map_from_coord
   which knows about map tiling and does coordinate and map translation.
common/object.c: Have update_object take another parameter which tells
    update object what has changed about the object.  This lets the function
    know if it should call update_position right away or if it can just
    mark the space as needing an update at a later time.  move update_position
    to map.c.
    insert_ob_in_map: now takes another parameter that describes actions not
    to do. modified to know about map tiling and do appropriate translation.
    Does some object sorting so it should handle spell objects more
    efficiently.
    insert_ob_in_map_simple is now replaced by
    using appropriate flag to this changed version of insert_ob_in_map.
    Clean up remove_ob - seemed to have done things in a more complicated
    fashion that is no longer necessary.  Modify check_walk_on to look
    at all objects on space, not those below the object - with changes to 
    insert_ob_in_map, new object won't always be on top.
common/porting.c: functions from ltostr.c, sqrt.c, as open_and_uncompress
    close_and_delete, make_path_to_file from map.c
common/treasure.c: Modified to use updated insert_ob_in_map
crossedit/Attr.c: Rename Layout to AppLayout so other files can use it.
crossedit/CrEdit.c: Modified to use new map header.  Modified drawing
    routines, as face values could be null
crossedit/Edit.c: Move many functions from common/map.c that are only
   used here and thus don't need to be in common/map.c.  Modify to use
   new map structure.
crossedit/Makefile.in: Change to use cproto to make proto.h file.
crossedit/png.c: change user_read_data to be static so proto doesn't pick
   it up.
doc/Makefile.in: add map-technical to list of files.
doc/crossfire.doc: remove map information that was in this file.
doc/map-technical: new file.  Describes inner workings of how the maps work.
include/config.h: remove RANDOM_ENCOUNTERS (no longer available) and
   USE_LIGHTING (now standard part and always on).
include/define.h: move P_... values to map.h
include/global.h: add definition for compression externals, as they
    are used in a few files.  remove map macro functions - moved to map.h
    as appropriate.  Add FREE_AND_CLEAR macro that frees data and then 
    sets the pointer to NULL.
include/map.h: Largely redone - many new macros, new map structure.
include/object.h: remove lights object link pointer from objects.
    At some #defines that are the flags for update_object and
    insert_ob_in_map
include/player.h: Add a few comments.

    wants darkness information or not.  Modify map update functions such
    that if the client does want darkness information, server does not
    send it.  Improve darkness handling so that if using the map1
    protocol command, send darkness for first blocked space due to
    darkness - this makes it possible for client to interpolate results
    better.

server/shop.c: Fix bug that resulted in items in shop being paid,
as well as not generating proper listing.  MSW 2001-06-06.

Checkin of code that supports larger map sizes (configurable in
config.h).
common/los.c: update los code since it only handled 11x11 maps.  Now
    uses formulatic approach so any map size should be supported.  This
    does result in a few more spaces getting blocked around corners,
    but it doesn't seem that bad - certainly not compared to the ability
    to have larger viewable maps.
common/map.c, crossedit/CrEdit.c, crossedit/Edit.c, include/global.h, 
    include/map.h,random_maps/monster.c,random_maps/special.c,

    as it prevented using those as variable/structure element names.
common/object.c: update_position - if faces for different layers are
    duplicate, set the duplicates to be blank to increase client
    update efficiency.
doc/Protocol: Add map1 command description, update setup command to
    describe setting of mapsize.
include/config.h: add MAP_CLIENT_X/Y to set maximum map size we can
    send to the client.
include/newserver.h: add mapx, mapy values to socket structure
include/player.h: Use MAP_CLIENT_X/Y for sizing arrays that hold
    map related information in player structure.
server/player.c: As per player.h above, use appropriate sizing when
    initializing player stucture.
server/shop.c: Update mapx,mapy like above, but re-do shop listings code as
     it was doing a lot more work than necessarily (I think some changes
     got put in for sorting, and the old object manipulation was never
     removed when that got done)
socket/init.c: set default client map size to 11x11 in the socket.
socket/item.c: LookAt - change checks for position checking (such that
     you can only look at things in bounds) use max viewable map size.
socket/request.c: Make setup commands a little more forgiving if there are
     extra spaces.  Add 'mapsize' command to setup command.  Update
     old map sending code to use socket map sizes (to support even
     smaller than normal maps, or 13x13 or 15x15 maps).  add draw_client_map1
     command which implements the map1 protocol command.

MSW 2001-04-28

common/object.c: Have update_object map the look window for redraw if
   the object is not something the client normally animates (like a lever).
   MSW 2001-04-27

server/apply.c: Modify apply_id_altar check for player - had a && instead of
    a ||.
socket/item.c: Modify ApplyCmd so a removed player can not apply objects.
   Fix crashes caused by players applying savebeds after they have
   used the bed.  MSW 2001-04-26

server/spell_util.c: have put_a_monster generate random monster
   abilities.
TODO, doc/mapguide: Various minor updates.
MSW 2001-04-25

server/c_object.c: Pass right object to query_cost_string so that
   if you pick up an unpaid object into a container, it generates
   the correct price.  MSW 2001-04-22
server/c_wiz.c: fix shutdown and reset_map wizard commands/function
   so they no longer crash the server.  MSW 2001-04-22

server/monster.c: add check to was_destroyed when monster fires an
   arrow.  Call was certainly missing, and appears to be responsible for
   crash.  MSW 2001-04-20

server/player.c: Clear op->chosen_skill when we get to the play_again
   prompt.  Otherwise, the server may try to use this later on, and it
   no longer points to a valid object, so it results in a crash.
   MSW 2001-04-19

server/skill_util.c: Add missing call to out_of_map in skill_attack which
  could result in crashes if player is at edge of maps and decides to attack
  in direction off map.  MSW 2001-04-18

server/attack.c: Remove error message about golem without owners,
   also add better checking before clering the op->contr->golem field.
common/map.c: set status flag on maps to MAP_SAVING so remove_ob does
   not do extra work when we are deleting a map (ie, immediate reset)
   from emory.
server/skills.c: If someone is stolen from a player, send an esrv_delete_item
   to the client so the clients inventory remains correct.
MSW 2001-04-16

common/re-cmp.c: Modify re_cmp functiion so that it properly matches
  strings not at the start 'ie, dude chain will now match against
  the chain value'. 
server/monster.c: Properly alter direction monster moves if they are
  feared or confused.  It was properly altering direction when monsters
  were using range attacks, but not if they were just wanting to move.
MSW 2001-04-12

common/living.c: Don't use the last_heal object in experience objects as 
   sp regen penalty.  This should fix the problem of inconsistent sp regen
   rates - last_heal is used in experience objects if the permanent experience
   option is turned on.  MSW 2001-04-11

PeterM:  
server/spell_util.c:  fix peace so it gives experience
common/button.c:  change the "error" to a "debug" message
   to reduce server crashing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for 0.98.0:

server/skills.c: Modify inscription so that when inscribing cleric spells,
    it reduces grace.  Before, reduced mana no matter the type of spell.
server/c_object.c: Fix bug in pick_up where it was not using the right
   count for picking up objects if the player did not specify one.  This
   allowed players to put objects into containers that should not really
   fit.
server/player.c:  Don't let players shoot arrows at themself.  Also,
   minor changes to use new_draw_info_format.
server/swap.c: If recycle temp maps, don't save out random maps to
   get recycled.  MSW 2001/04/07

PeterM  2001/04/06:  
include/libproto.h common/object.c server/apply.c server/spell_util.c
Added a new function:  instead of stacking many burnout or firetrail
objects, only 1 per square is added.  Real reduction in server overhead.
No reduction in cosmetic effect.

common/porting.c: Fix compile warnings/bugs introduced by Win32 changes.
server/time.c: Modify move_player_mover so that it determines direction
   of the mover and then process accordingly, as well as formatting
   changes.
server/c_object.c: modify examine so that it properly shows info about
    magic bullet spell books.  MSW 2001-04-05

common/item.c: Modify identify function to clear the NO_SKILL_IDENT
   flag so objects will now merge.  Also, once the object has been
   identified, the no_skill_ident doesn't have meaning anymore.
   MSW 2001-04-03

server/c_object:  Modify examine command to only be able to examine
   valid objects, and not whatever is on top of the space, which may be
   insivisible.  MSW 2001-04-01

include/sproto.h, server/c_wiz.c server/main.c server/player.c socket/loop.c:
Modify leave function to take a second parameter that determines if it
should print a message about the player leaving the game or not.  Proper
use of this prevents duplicate XXX left the game messages.  MSW 2001-03-29

common/image.c, include/define.h, include/global.h: Add empty_face structure
   and appropriate code to initialize it.  This is used for the server side
   look selection.
include/newserver.h: Add NUM_LOOK_OBJECTS to control number of look objects
   to send at any one time.  add look_position field to the newsocket
   structure.
server/move.c: clear look position as player moves.
server/player.c: initalize look_position element in structure.
socket/item.c: modify esrv_draw_look to sne NUM_LOOK_OBJECTS at any one
   time, and to also send pseudo objects that lets the player scroll up and down.
   modify ApplyCmd so that if it detects the application of one pseudo objects
   to adjust the look_position.
MSW 2001-03-29

common/readable.c: Name spellbooks based on level of spell, and not
    just randomly.  Patch by Preston Crow, applied by Mark Wedel 2001-03-29

configure, configure.in, include/autoconf.h, includes.h: add check for
   time.h and include it if we find it.
socket/item.c: esrv_move_object - have it check to see if the object is
   already on the ground before we try to re-drop it.  Likewise, check
   to see if it is already in players inventory before we try to pick
   it up.
common/object.c: Don't send face updates to the client or make
   the space as needing to be redrawn.  Client now deals with animation 
   of the look window on its own. 
utils/(metaserver.pl crossloop add_throw.perl crossloop.pl) 
lib/(Makefie.in, checkarch.pl collect.pl xpmtopix.pl) - - deleted
   from CVS - '.in' versions of these files now exist and the real
   versions are created as part of the configure process.  Update 
   Makefile.in to reflect this change.
MSW 2001/03/28

common/object.c: have update_position just update the flag that the
   server needs to send the look window to the client and don't send the
   item at this point, as sending the look will do that.
server/main.c: process_players1: Remove call to draw (which updates
   the client map) - the handle newclient in socket/loop.c already
   does this and there is no reason to send multiple instances of the
   same map.
MSW 2001/03/23

server/c_object.c: drop_object function: send delete item to client as
   item is dropped.  This fixes a problem of phantom objects in the
   inventory.  Unrelated change to not call esrv_send_item for objects
   that are dropped - esrv_draw_look will get called later on and will
   update this at that time.  MSW 2001/03/23

server/c_object.c: Update the return value for some matches - they
   function was returning immediately when it got a match, but did not give
   them a high match value, so searching for 'key ring' used to return a
   match value of 6 or so on the key ring, but a 14 on a key.

common/object.c: Modify find_free_spot to call arch_out_of_map so that
   it properly deals with multipart objects.
server/main.c: Fix enter_map so that we first use the golem (and not player)
   when calling find_free_spot.  Also, modify code so that it properly
   updates coordinates of the multipart golem.
MSW 2001/03/20

server/skills.c: Fix orate so that we check for a positive chance (and just
not nonzero chance) for successful oration.  Due to adjustments, at low levels,
the oratory chance can be negative.  MSW 2001/03/20

server/spell_effect.c: Change cast_change_attr to find an enemy (and not
friend) when casting the curse spell.  MSW 2001/03/20

server/apply.c: Increase size of buf to be a HUGE_BUF to very
long item names don't cause a stack overflow.  MSW 2001/03/20

common/object.c: Modify update_position so that we don't show invisible
players to other players.  MSW 2001/03/20

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 0.97.0:

MSW 2001/03/18:
common/init.c: add RESET_LOCATION_TIME initializer to settings structure.
include/config.h: Add RESET_LOCATION_TIME value.  If nonzero and the save was longer than 
    the specified time in seconds, player will be returned home upon login from
    save.
include/global.h: Add reset_loc_time field to settings structure.
server/login.c: Remove some unused variables, add support to return player
   home as described above.
server/spell_effect.c: Fix for crashes when casting control undead and your
   god does not have an enemy.  Now properly check to make sure we are not
   dereferencing null pointers.


MSW 2001/03/16:
Change code so that if player dies and loading the players savebed map does
not work, return player to EMERGENCY_MAPPATH instead.  New function added
to server/main.c called enter_player_savebed which does the work,
Files changed: include/sproto.h server/main.c server/player.c
    server/spell_effect.c (comment added)
Unrelated change: Remove messages about multiple resist types set.
Files changed: common/loader.l common/loader.c

MSW 2001/03/15:
server/spell_effect.c: Add physical attacktype when casting holy possession.
    Otherwise, characters who use karate end up not being able to damaage
     anything.

MSW 2001/03/09:
crossedit/App.c: Move the loading of images to later in the editor
    startup state.  In this way, the client can allocate the colors it
    needs for its windows before the the png images use up all the colors.
crossedit/png.c: New png loader implementation.  New version is much
   faster (50 times faster).  As part of this, only 8 bit displays,
   a private colormap will be allocated, and after that gets filled
   up, a color mapping routine will be used - this makes the png
   images loadable on an 8 bit system in addition to the speedup.
crossedit/xutil.c: Adding timing information for loading of images.
   call init_pngx_loader before starting to load png images.  Pass
   colormap to png_to_xpixmap by pointer and not value so that
   the loader can change the colormap.

AV 2001/03/09:
common/button.c: Added new attribute to altar triggers: "last_sp 1".
    If set, the altar trigger will push the connected value only
    by dropping the sacrifice, NOT by altar reset. If unset ("last_sp 0")
    it will work like it used to (push by sacrifice and by reset).

MSW 2001/03/06:
server/spell_effect.c: Fix message when consecration fails - use the ob->name
    field and not the ob->title field.  Also fix broken logic that checked
    for the floor.
server/init.c: Related to 3-4 change which changed the default name of
    the logfile to "" so we know to use stderr.  This doesn't work for
    daemon mode, so if the name is "", we use the default logfile instead.

MSW 2001/03/04:
TODO: add re-connecting player to new client if client logs in with
    right name/password.
common/init.c: Open up the logfile with the provide filename when given
    the -log option.
server/init.c: Make set_logfile a first pass option so the init_library
    has the right logfile name to work with.
server/main.c: Fix crash if map has an exit path yet that file does not
    exist.  Give proper error message.


MSW 2001/03/01:
server/main.c: Modified random_map code so the server will not
     crash if the exit object has no message (and thus variables to set
     for the random map).
     Modified so that golems move away from player when player
     changes map.  Values were reversed before, causing the golem to move
     towards the player.

MSW 2001/02/25: General player login cleanup.  This should fix the crash
    when players re-roll stats too often.  So far, it also seems to
    have the additional effect that calculated players on map now appears
    to be correct.
common/player.c: No longer allocate the player object structure in
    get_player_ob (function is really misnamed).  Callers to this function
    were not using the allocated function.
server/login.c: Add leave_map call when player is loaded.
server/main.c: Add leave_map function.
server/player.c: Move get_player function to start of file - can declare
    it static that way.  Move some initialize from add_player to get_player.
    Add set_first_map function.  Add appropriate calls to leave_map
    and set_first_map when players join and leaves the game.

MSW 2001/02/22:
TODO: Add some items, remove some others, remove outline of future versions,
    since it was out of date.
common/loader.l,loader.c: Declare msgbuf a static outside the lex_load function.
    lex_load was otherwise clearing it each time it was called, which resulted
    in empty messages for the random artifacts (since the call lex_load one
    line at a time).  Instead, we just zero this at start of load_object.
    Original reason of this change was due to purify errors - as I look at the
    code, it appears even before these changes that it was clearing the buffer
    properly.
common/map.c: removing pending field from map objects.
common/re-cmp.c: Comment out some code which was resulting in too many
    false compares.
include/config.h: increase default for MAX_OBJECTS.  6000 is a bit small
    on current systems.
include/map.h: Remove pending field from map structure.
random_maps/treasure.c: Increase size of doorlist.  Fixes crash, in that
    if a random map could place 8 doors around the treasure, the list
    was not terminated, so the problem would eventually try to read/dereference
    random memory after the array.
server/c_misc.c: Remove pending field from maps, so remove functions
    and other places that referred to it (like the maps command)
server/c_wiz.c: fix up wiz map reset command.  Not really tested, but
    old code had some definate problems just from visual inspection.
server/main.c: Further fix for unique exits - relative paths to unique maps
    from non unique maps should now work.
server/monster.c: Various fixes - one is that should get more reliable distance
    values for multipart monsters.  Second, modify dist_att to calculate from
    closest part of monster, and not the head of the monster.
server/pets.c: Remove code dealing with pending objects.
server/player.c: Don't remove invisible objects in players inventory when
    playing with permadeath mode.
server/spell_util.c: If you try to cast denied spell, it no longer costs any
    spellpoints.
socket/item.c: Fix bug where it was using 'item' protocol command instead of
    'item1'
End of MSW 2001/02/22 checkin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 0.96.0:

MSW 2001/01/11:
include/rproto.h: Rebuilt for new random map code.
server/player.c: remove player insert in key_roll_stat - player is already
    inserted.
server/swap.c: When swapping out map, see if it has already reached reset time,
    and if so, just delete it and not save it.  In flush_old_maps, now have
    it check for maps that have no timeout set - this sometimes happens when
    players save/die on maps.


MSW 2001/01/11:
Other than various general cleanups, the main change this code does is
that style maps (for random maps) get loaded special now - they objects
they contain are not put on the active list, and they use a private map
list so they do not appear in the output of the 'maps command.
common/arch.c, common/treasure.c,server/login.c: Update calls to load_object
common/loaderl.l,loader.c: Update lex_load to take an optional flags option.
    This is currently only used so that the loader can decide if it should
    call update_ob_speedto put objects on the active list or not.
    Calls to lex_load updated.  load_object modified to take another option
common.map.c: remove PROCESS_WHILE_LOADING and CHECK_ACTIVE_MAPS ifdefs.
    update calls to load_object.  Remove some dead code.
include/config.h: Remove CHECK_ACTIVE_MAPS and PROCESS_WHILE_LOADING flags.
    Those options did not work, and in all likelihood, this would be done
    via threading now days and not what code was there.
include/libproto.h, sproto.h: updated or various function changes.
include/map.h: Add MAP_STYLE flag.
random_maps/exit.c: Call set_map_timeout after we load the final map
    so it will get swapped out.
random_maps/standalone.c: Add dummy set_map_timeout function so it compiles.
random_maps/style.c: Add load_style_map function which does the job of
    actually checking to see if a style map is in memory, and if not,
    loads it up.  Updates the pointers so it appears on a map style map list
    and not the general map list.
server/main.c: create set_map_timeout function that deals with setting the
    map timeouts.  Fix bug so server doesn't crash if two players kill each
    other on hall of selection.
server/monster.c remove dead code.
socket/loop.c: If realloc fails, catch it and exit with meaningful
    error message.
End of MSW 2001/02/11 checkin.

MSW 2001/02/08:
server/login.c:Fix that would prevent maps from getting swapped out properly -
we would try to swap out a map the player is in the process of leaving - move
swap out code until after we have moved the player to the new map.  MSW
2001-02-08


MSW 2001/02/06:
common/porting.c: relocate clean_path from this file to server/main.c
server/main.c: relocate clean_path from porting.c.  Add unclean_path.
    Modify enter_unique_exit so it supports relative maps on unique maps.
    Modify enter_exit so word of recall (or other forcelike fields), work
    when the return point is a swapped out unique map.

MSW 2001/02/05:
server/attack.c: Fix blind and paralyze - logic for reducing duration was
   broken, resulting in zero duration for most characters.  It should now
   work properly, reducing according to the amount of protection.


MSW 2001/02/02:
common/item.c: Don't have armour item types get returned as magical if they
    have an armour value - that is to be expected. This eliminates the false
    positives that you otherwise get on armor when you cast detect magic.
include/newserver/h: and checksum field to FaceInfo struct.  Update
    version_sc to 1026.
socket/init.c: calculate image checksums as we load the images.
socket/request.c: If client is at least version_Sc 1026, use face1 protocol
    command that includes the checksum.

MSW 2001/01/31:
common/object.c: Fix that that spells cast on spaces with no floors get 
    set properly after the spell expires.
common/player.c: Use skill tools first (lockpicks, talismans, etc) before
    using native skills.  In this way, an object with bonus automatically
    gets used.
common/living.c:  Fix so that negative con bonuses work properly - fixes
    bug where a higher con could result in lower total hp due to improper
    calculation.

MSW 2001/01/30:
Complete rewrite of the exit handling code.  Hopefully as an effect, this will
fix the player appearing in the middle of the oceans.  I think the code
should also work better in many other areas.  Main enhancements is a 3x3
area for pets to follow player to new map, as well as golems now following
players to the new maps.
include/sproto.h, random_maps/rproto.h - rebuilt.
random_maps/random_map.c: Change generate_random_map to take a structure 
    with the random map paremeters.
random_maps/reader.l, reader.c: Add set_random_map_variable function that
    reads the map parameters from a char buffer.  Also, remove some leftover
    comments that were from the common/loader.l file.
random_maps/rogue_layout.c: Change some functions to be static so make proto
    doesn't collect them.
random_maps/standalone.c: Add opening of parms file into main function since
    it ws removed from the random_map.c file.
server/apply.c: Don't display the message of random maps to the players
    as they enter them, as this message is random map parameters, and not
    a real message.
server/login.c: #if 0 out using of the player loading element in the structure.
    this isn't used right now.
server/main.c: Bulk of the changes.  main changes are to break apart the
    old enter_exit function into smaller functions that more logically do
    the needed function (random maps, unique maps, and transferring the player
    to the new map).  random map code now passes the parameters via
    structure instead of file in /tmp.  Code is much more understandable now
    and hopefully bugfree.
server/pets.c: minor changes/bugfixes.  Search full SIZEOFFREE array, use
    real owner variable when print out messages.
server/player.c: Remove usage of the loading variable in the player structure.
End of MSW 2001/01/30 checking.

MSW 2001/01/23:
Various cleanups/fixes as detected by purify:
common/anim.c: animation[0] was given a null pointer as the name, but
	bsearch/or comparison function will try to de-reference it.
	Give it a unique name.
common/loader.l: msgbuf was being used initialized in the main loading
	function.  loader.c also regenerated.
common/object.c: find_free functions were not checking to see if the
	spaces they were examining were out of the map.  Added checks
	to do so.
server/apply.c: buf was being used uninitialized in the function.
socket/init.c: input buffer needs to be initialized as we do a 
	strncasecmp against the buffer which may not have any data in it.


MSW 2001/01/18:
server/skill_util.c: add change_skill_to_skill function to be used when
   we already know the skill object we want to use.  This is more efficient
   than change_skill which takes a skill number and then searches the
   inventory for the object.
   remove extra esrv_send_item from do_skill_attack - don't need to send
   skills to player.
   do_skill_attack: remove call to hth_damage - that function does not take
   into account objects in the player inventory that increase damage,
   and since that is called each attack, it is not feasible to have it
   search the players inventory.  Instead, we just rely on damage generated
   by fix_player - only think hth_damage did was adjust damage based on
   level difference.

PeterM 2001/01/16
Added randomly-generated nethack-style maps to crossfire's
random map generator.

MSW 2001/01/15:
Change blindness and paralyze so that duration is reduced based on protection
the player has. file server/attack.c

MSW 2001/01/15:
Various fixes for friendly object code:
common/button.c: Add missing call to remove_friendly_object
common/friend.c: Pretty much completely re-written.  add_friendly_object now
    checks to make sure the object being added isn't already on the list,
    remove_friendly_object will remove objects whose tags don't match,
    and added clean_friendly_list.
common/object.c:  No reason to use the function pointer to
    remove_friendly_object since that function is in the lib.
common/time.c: Make DEBUG_TIME always on (no longer compile time option).
    other areas use the global var pticks, so if it was turned off, compile
    would break anyways.
common/treasuer.c: No longer print debug messages on artifacts created.
    Cluttered log file making it hard to see more important errors.
include/config.h: Remove DEBUG_TIME define.
include/libproto.h: Rebuilt for clean_friendly_list function.
server/main.c: rewrote do_specials to do things based on pticks variable.
    This allows various specials to be spread out across multiple ticks
    easier.  Also, added clean_friendly_function to part of what this does.
server/skills.c: add missing call to remove_friendly_object.  Also, removed
    from #if 0 .. #else .. #endif code.
End of MSW 2000/01/15 checkin.

PeterM 2001/01/08:  Wrathful Eye spell implemented.

MSW 2000/12/26:
Checkin of Jan's new god intervention code.  I haven't played around with
it much, but I haven't seen any really obvious problems.
common/living.c: remove learn_prayer_chance
common/treasure.c: Various changes to treasure generation - mostly to
    deal with starting equipment and putting it in the inventory.
doc/crossfire.doc: Update docs on god intervention.
include/define.h: GT_... flags removed.
include/treasure.h: GT_... flags added.  Addition flags added from
    what was in define.h before.
lib/archetypes, lib/crossfire.png, lib/treasures: Updated with new
    archetypes and treasures.
random_maps/standalone.c,server/rune.c,server/time.c: Calls to 
    create_treasure updated
server/apply.c:  New functions for god intervention added, update calls
     to create_treasure, other god related changes.
server/c_wiz.c: Calls to create_treasure updated, various functions to
    allow DM's to learn/unlearn spells added.
server/commands.c: Various commands added to the wiz set of commands.
    See commen for c_wiz.c
server/disease.c: Changes to reduce_symptoms
server/gods.c: Numerous updates for god intervention code.
server/player.c: Modifications for starting player equipment.
server/skill_util.c: Display the god the character worships when they
     issue the skills command.
server/skills.c: Minor cosmetic change made to message when praying on altar.
server/spell_effect.c: Changes related to gods, cure spells, and
     generation of treasures & items.
End of MSW 2000/12/26 checkin.


MSW 2000/12/23:
include/define.h: Add SIZEOFFREE1 and SIZEOFFREE2 values to use instead of
    arbitrary constants in the code.
server/monster.c: change communicate function to use above values.  Before
    it was stopping one short of the full 2 space array, so one particular
    space (-1, -2 relative to player) would not hear players speech.
server/attack.c:  Don't exit hit_player function if damage is reduced to 0
    in magical attacks.  This was preventing face of death and probably a lot
    of effect only spells from working.
server/spell_util.c: modify check_cone_push to use move_object to blow
    the objects.  Before, multisquare monsters were getting sliced
    into their individual components - move_object deals with multisquare objects
    properly.

PeterM 2000/12/18:  Re-add the conflict spell (various files)
attack.c:  fix a bug which could easily have led to seg fault,
          and did when I was testing under efence.

MSW 2000/12/17: Various changes.  Note that the scope of files in this checkin
make it appear that a lot was changed, but in fact it was mostly just
re-orginization - very little code has actually changed.
include/autoconf.h.in: Add HAVE_LIBDES to file.
include/config.h: Remove comments after defines for MAP_MIN/MAX timeouts.
	This just removes some warnings during compile.  comments are now
	on lines by themselves.
include/player.h: remove shootstrength for player structure.  It was unused.
server/Makefile.in: remove input.c file, add c_range.c file.
server/c_chat.c: remove command_last, add command_shout and command_tell
	from input.c to this file.  Also fix bug in command tell which
	would let players crash server at will.
server/c_misc.c,server/c_object.c: Relocate many functions
	 from input.c into these files.
server/c_move.c, server/c_new.c: Add standard crossfire banner comment.
server/c_range.c: New file - contains range related commands, 
	including spell casting (relocated from input.c)
server/c_wiz.c: move command_invisible from input.c into this file.
server/commands.c: Remove unused commands (bell, last, strength)
server/input.c: removed file.
server/main.c: Change HAVE_DES_H to HAVE_LIBDES
server/player.c: When choosing a race, draw it facing south for best
	presentation of image.
server/spell_util.c: Remove dead code (#if 0 shootstrength related
	code)
socket/loop.c: remove unused variables.
NOTE: Due to the addition/removal of files, you will need to do
'config.status; make depend; make' from the top level directory for
everything to be compiled properly.
End of MSW 2000/12/17 checkin.


PeterM:  2000/12/17: Various problems fixed in
random_maps/*.c:  endless loop removed,
exit leading to blocked area of spiral fixed.


PeterM:  2000/12/17: Stat max bug fixed.  
server/apply.c


MSW 2000/12/16:
server/player.c: If the player race archetype has a message, print that out.
	This allows a descriptive message about what the different races will
	get.  The message is removed from the player once they decide on the
	race.
common/living.c:  Add some parens around some PR resistant checks - eliminates
	warnings from gcc.
server/disease.c: have cure_disease remove all diseases a player is infected
	with.  The code suggested it was attempting to do so, and the
	messages it printed out certainly suggested that the character
	was disease free.


PeterM:  2000/12/14:  Added spiral map layout

PeterM:  2000/12/14:
Restructuring of the random map code.  Functionally, it
should be identical.  All global variables moved into the
functions.

MSW 2000/12/10:
utils/metaserver.pl: Various improvements.  Main one is that tcp
connections to port 13326 of the metaserver will dump the information
in a easily parsable format for the client or other applications.
include/config.h: Set ARCHTABLE size to correct value.
server/player.c: Have server send update item to client for players face
	while select class.  Added esrv_new_player in Roll_Again, because
	without it, the client had yet to receive information on what tag
	the player was so could not make sense of the updated face.
server/spell_effect.c: Balance issues for polymorph.  Reduce maximum
	value for high valued objects, remove ability to polymorph generators,
	put maximum level on polymorphed monsters and give them saving
	throws against the effects.

MSW 2000/12/5:
server/player.c: Move location of where it sets the player has_hit variable
until after we have confirmed that the player has actually attacked a monster
and not that the space is blocked.  Fixes various problems and make
behaviour more predictable.
common/button.c: Do not set path_attuned when loading connected objects from within
the editor.  This is normally done for random map code/glue logic.
common/player.c: When trying to find a skill to use, use a native skill
first before going off and returning a skill object like a talisman.

MSW 2000/12/4:
common/treasure.c: Make it so resistances from artifact files are absolute 
	adjustments.
Makefile.in configure configure.in: Fix check for libdes to see if des_crypt
	exists in libdes before setting HAVE_LIBDES
crossedit/Makefile.in:  Add Cnv/libCnv.a before LIBS - should fix
	linking error on irix systems.
utils/metaserver.pl: modified so it ignores entries from hosts that 
	report their name as put.your.hostname.here

MSW 2000/12/3:
crossedit/Attr.c: Add the new resist names to set of variables one can set.

MSW 2000/12/3:
Misc changes.  Main one is adding PNG support to the editor.
TODO: Remove outdated things to do (like partial resistance code)
configure, configure.in, include/autoconf.h.in: Add check for libpng.
include/global.h: Remove displaymodes - moved to crossedit/Defines.h
crossedit/App.c, crossedit/App.h crossedit/CrEdit.c crossedit/CrFace.c
  crossedit/CrList.c crossedit/CrUtil.c crossedit/Edit.c crossedit/crossedit.c 
  crossedit/xutil.c, crossedit/png.c (new file): Add support for png display
  in crossedit.
crossedit/Makefile.in:  Add png.c file.
server/c_misc.c: Change who command to only display real players, and not
  players in process of connecting/unconnecting.  Also, remove code to display
  old sockets, since those are not supported anymore.

MSW 2000/12/3:
Checking for partial resistance code.  Various minor errors also fixed
(compiler warnings, unused variables, Makefile.in changes, etc).
PR code also includes support to send protections to the client.

Changes for 0.95.8:

MSW 2000/11/26:
utils/metaserver.pl (added), utils/Makefile.in:  Add metaserver.pl script.

MSW 2000/11/25:
include/patchlevel.h (removed), doc/spell-docs/Makefile (removed),
include/Makefile.in, include/version.h, server/init.c, server/main.c,
socket/metaserver.c: remove patchlevel.h - include the patchlevel in the
 version.h file, update other files to use version as a single string.

MSW 2000/11/25:
socket/metaserver.c: If on FreeBSD systems, do not attempt to connect to
the metaserve.  FreeBSD seems to have a problem using sendto on a connected
soccket.

MSW 2000/11/25:
configure.in, configure, include/autoconf.h.in, server/main.c:  Update
to check for libdes.a and des.h and use those for password decryption - fixes
a problem on freebsd if it is using md5 crypt.  Hopefully it doesn't break
anything.  main.c was also checking for HAVE_CRYPT_H too early.
include/sproto.h:  Needed updating.  Unrelated to above changes.


MSW 2000/11/22
server/main.c:  Modify enter_exit so that it properly uses per player
unique maps that are only in memory and not on disk.  Remove unused
variable from process events (unrelated change).

PeterM  2000/11/18:
  New spells added:
  1)  Sanctuary   (aura of counterwall)
  2)  Peace	  (make monsters unable to fight)
  3)  Spiderweb   (create spider webs)
  4)  rage	  (heroism, armour, haste, regenration combined)
  5)  forked lightning  (lightning which forks and strikes )
  6)  flaming aura  (aura of fire)
  7)  vitriol     combined ball/cone/pool acid attack spell
  8)  vitriol splash  (spell for internal use only)
  9)  ironwood skin  (clerical version of armour spell)

Not implemented:  10) poison fog

MSW 2000/11/17:
socket/metaserver.c:  More changes - use fcntl to set O_NONBLOCK.  Don't
   close socket if connect fails, since with sendto it is not required
   that the connect works.

PeterM:  2000/11/17
define.h spells.h spellist.h spell_util.c spell_effect.c:
  windstorm spell implemented.
attack.c:  saving throw behavior modified.  Items take a bit
of DAM to destroy now instead of being destroyed with 1hp attacks.

MSW: 2000/11/16:
socket/metaserver.c: Add #ifdef MSG_DONTWAIT into metaserver.c for systems 
	that lack that definition.
random_maps/style.c: alphasort was not properly de-referencing pointers
	when doing name comparisons, and thus returned garbage results,
	resulting in a crash when entering random maps.  This only happens
	for systems which lack scandir in normal libraries (like Solaris).
	BSDs and linux have scandir built in, and did not have a problem.
server/disease.c: fix infect_object - server would crash if player did
	not have praying skill and was infecting someone else.
end of changes, MSW 2000/11/16

PeterM : 2000/11/14
PeterM: Made some changes so that non-disease effects may be done without
being labelled as a disease.  Also, fixed a bug in which we'd kill something
and then try to insert something in the killed thing's map.



metaserver update:
common/init.c: Add meta_ fields to settings structure initialization.
include/global.h: Add meta_ fields to settings structure.
include/sockproto.h: Updated for new meta_ functions.
lib/Makefile.in: Have it install settings file.
lib/settings: Default settings file with some metaserver default value.s
server/init.c: Add load_settings file.  Add call to metaserver_init.
server/main.c: Add call to metaserver_update in do_specials.
socket/Makefile.in: Add metaserver.c to list of files.
socket/metaserver.c:  File that deals with metaserver related data.
socket/item.c: Remove some unused variables.  Unrelated to metaserver changes.
socket/loop.c: Add calls to metaserver_update in block_until_new)connection.  Change
	function so that if there are no active players, it still timeouts and
	does metaserver update.  Basically changed to do it the way the
	WATCHDOG code did it.
End of metaserver update.  MSW 2000-11-13

server/player.c:  removed unused tmp2 variable from move_player_attack.
modify depletion in kill_player so the maximum depletion for a stat is -50.  This
should preven stat wrapping from -126 to 127.  MSW 2000-11-08

==============================================================================
MSW 2000-11-07
common/item.c: query_base_name was not return plural version of items
with 'of' in name.  Also, much of the function was not using safe_strcat,
which could result in buffer overlow problems.

common/object.c: Change update_position so that we always generate
3 images per space.  This fixes players standing on top of dragon transports,
but generally works for things like monsters standing on objects.
insert_ob_in_map:  change 'return' statement to 'return NULL'.  Also
remove unused map pointer.
decrease_ob_nr:  Fix bug for client updates when player drops item that
is then consume.  It was using op->above after object was removed to
find the player.  Store above pointer before we remove the object.

socket/item.c:  Don't terminate pointer as returned by query_base_name -
instead, terminator buffer after we copy it.  For simple object,
query_base_name may directly return a pointer to the objects name
which is only long enough to hold the name itself.

socket/lowlevel.c:  Abort if we are trying to send the client a packet
longer than supported by the protocol.  Since that buffer is static,
overflowing it will just create memory corruption - easier to stop
then than try and debug it later.

End of MSW checkin 2000-11-7

PeterM:  2000-11-06
server/spell_util.c	crash bug removed from move ball lightning:
ball lightning mover improved in general.  --PeterM

--------------------------------------------
--- BEGIN stop_item() / attack fix patch ---  Jan Echternach 2000-11-06
--------------------------------------------

Summary of this patch:  Provide new stop_item() function for properly
handling "moving" items on a map (flying arrows, thrown objects,
active cones); obsoletes the workarounds.  Fix some attack bugs (with
possible server crashes) - many attackers attacked while being
removed, even though much code could only handle the attacker being on
the same map as the victim (not even the attacker being in the
victim's inventory, e.g. poison).

common/object.c: insert_ob_in_map():  Call check_walk_on() after
update_object() because the latter needs to update some very
important flags used by a lot of code before this code is called
by check_walk_on().

common/object.c: get_split_ob():  Completed support for splitting
removed objects.

common/object.c: decrease_ob_nr(): Rewrote this function: Added
support for removed objects.  Removing an object completely didn't
always update the environment's weight properly.  Removing an amount
of 0 from an object with nrof == 0 destroyed the object.  Improved
performance a bit (don't need to update the player's weight if an
object below the player is modified).

server/apply.c: move_apply():  Added recursion limit.

server/apply.c: move_apply(): THROWN_OBJ and ARROW:  Use new
hit_with_arrow() function.

server/apply.c: move_apply(): FBULLET and BULLET:  Call
check_fired_arch() only when the victim blocks the square (FLAG_NO_PASS
or FLAG_ALIVE).

server/attack.c: save_throw_object():  Use new stop_item() function
before trying to modify an object.  Added originator to all
insert_ob_in_map() calls.

server/attack.c: hit_map():  Added log message if the hitter is not on
a map.  Added was_destroyed() check after calling save_throw_object().

server/attack.c: get_attack_mode() and abort_attack():  New functions
to determine the type of attack (simple or full attack).

server/attack.c: attack_ob():  Now only attack_ob_simple() with default
damage and weapon class values.

server/attack.c: attack_ob_simple():  Contains most of old attack_ob(),
but takes damage and weapon class as parameters, needed for
hit_with_arrow().  Uses get_attack_mode() and abort_attack() to
support new "simple" attack mode.

server/attack.c: stick_arrow() and hit_with_arrow():  Moved those parts
of old stop_arrow() and move_arrow() that dealt with attacking a
victim over here.

server/attack.c: hit_player():  Uses get_attack_mode() and
abort_attack() to support new "simple" attack mode.

server/attack.c: paralyze_player():  Use insert_ob_in_map_simple()
instead of insert_ob_in_map() because the callers are not prepared for
this function triggering any complex machinery, and
insert_ob_in_map_simple() should be enough for plain visual effects.

server/attack.c: thrown_item_effect():  Don't need to deal with thrown
objects, hit_with_arrow() already does everything necessary.

server/attack.c: adj_attackroll():  Added log message if hitter and
victim are not on the same map.

server/c_object.c:  Fixed two typos in "can't pick up xxx" messages.

server/c_object.c: pick_up_object():  Removed can_pick() check because
pick_up() already checks this.  Added support for picking up removed
objects because the stop_item() in pick_up() can now call us with
removed objects.  Moved FLAG_STARTEQUIP check to pick_up().  Fixed
weight limit lookup for monsters that have strength > MAX_STAT.

server/c_object.c: pick_up():  Use new stop_item() function.

server/player.c: fire_bow() and server/skills.c: do_throw():  Removed
FLAG_NO_PICK workaround for flying objects.  stop_item() now handles
this correctly.

server/rune.c: spring_trap():  Fix unlimited trap recursion.  Since
traps are triggered by move_apply(), the result of triggering a trap
may trigger the trap again before it is deactivated.

server/rune.c: spring_trap():  Runes that don't cast spells can only be
triggered by living objects.

server/spell_effect.c: move_cancellation():  Don't call hit_map() with
a removed attacker.

server/spell_util.c: cast_cone():  Only print warning message about
cones that don't have FLAG_FLY/WALK_ON if the cone does any damage.

server/spell_util.c: move_cone():  Removed workaround for cones in ice
cubes.  stop_item() now handles this correctly.

server/spell_util.c: explode_object(): Rewrote this function: New
interface - exploding object must not be removed when the function is
called, it must have an other_arch (i.e. it must be able to explode),
and it will be gone for sure when the function terminates.  Removed
some code with no effect.  Don't call any attack functions with
removed attackers.

server/spell_util.c: check_fired_arch():  Rewrote this function.

server/spell_util.c: move_fired_arch():  Rewrote most of this function:
Don't attack with removed attackers.  Call check_fired_arch() instead
of duplicating its code.

server/spell_util.c: move_ball_lightning():  Don't attack with removed
attackers.  Rewrote the movement algorithm to simplify this task.

server/time.c: stop_item() and fix_stopped_item:  New functions.

server/time.c: fix_stopped_arrow():  Contains most of the old
stop_arrow() function.  Unlike stop_arrow(), it takes an arrow that is
not removed.  Removed FLACK_NO_PICK workaround.

server/time.c: stop_arrow():  Stops arrows and thrown objects and puts
them on the map.  Sticking objects into targets is no longer handled
by stop_arrow(), but by hit_with_arrow().

server/time.c: move_arrow():  Don't attack with removed attackers.

socket/item.c: esrv_move_object():  Removed misleading comment.

------------------------------------------
--- END stop_item() / attack fix patch ---  Jan Echternach 2000-11-06
------------------------------------------

server/time.c:  Add call to esrv_update_item to update the face for
the client after the player chooses a class.  MSW 11/3/2000

server/c_object.c, socket/item.c:  Fixed for long item support.  pick_up_object
in c_object was overwriting a fixed length string, causing server crashes.
item.c was not properly terminating plural version of object name, resulting
in corrupt packets being sent to the client.  MSW 11/2/2000

PeterM:
  ball lightning made stronger, strikes larger area, never
  hits player.
  divine shock spell added.

include/sproto.h:  Removed prototype of obsolete make_gravestone()
function.
server/apply.c:  Put back gravestone_text() function that was removed
accidently a while ago, needed by NOT_PERMADEATH.
server/player.c:  Don't use the dead player as the originator of object
movements.  Fixed string handling for NOT_PERMADEATH.
- Jan Echternach 10/30/2000


Major race/class change by PeterM:
BEGIN:
*****************
apply.c:  new function, apply changes to player.  If the change is a CLASS,
player receives certain attributes from the class. 

login.c:  make sure people using the old race/class archetypes in their
player files can still use them.

player.c:  
1) give_initial_items modified for greater flexibility:  you
can pass in a treasurelist.  
2) Also, initial forces are applied to the player.
3) Comment added on the stat roll function.  
4) Word of recall into the new class-choice map (unfortunately hard-wired.) for newly-rolled players.
5) gen_sp and gen_hp and gen_grace now allowed to go negative to slow down player
regen.

skill_util.c
1)  Don't give out basic skills anymore.  This interferes with the class code.

spell_util.c
1)  Praying failures moderated in frequency.
2)  Summoned creatures enhanced in wc, speed, depending on casting level.
3)  Word of recall allowed to work in no-magic areas if a flag is set.

time.c
1)  Move player changer function added.
2)  Marker object expiration added.

living.c:  cleric fail chance array modified.

map.c: bugfix for random map/recycle tmp map problem.

define.h:  defines added for playerchangers and class types
           base 10 numbers added for the spell paths.

spellist.h: fixed up summoning spells a little

sproto.h:  new prototypes

config.h:  hate RECYCLE_TMP_MAPS, turned it off
  
maps/HallOfSelection:  new map for class choice.

lib/treasures:  classs/race stuff heavily modified
lib/archetypes, animation, bmaps, bmaps.paths, crossfire.png faces
    crossfire.xbm  New faces, etc.

END race/class stuff 10/16/2000
apply.c:  bugfix for random map/recycle tmp maps interaction.  --PeterM 10/16/200

include/skill* server/skill_util.c:  levitation skill added.
9/26/2000.  --PeterM

common/map.c server/apply.c:  Fix an interaction between
RECYCLE_TMP_MAPS and random maps which would cause crashing.
peterm: 10/12/2000

disease.c spell_effect.c:  peterm: 10/5/2000
1)  Diseases moderated in power by ~1/2 and randomized.
    Now monsters can have a mild/moderate/serious/fatal case
    of a particular disease.
2)  cause disease spells modified to NOT go through objects
    spells ordinarily couldn't go through.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for 0.95.7:

README: Add crossfire.csua.berkeley.edu server.
TODO: Remove entry about setable behaviour for keyrings, since that has now
been done.
include/patchlevel.h, Makefile.in:  Update for 0.95.7  MSW 9/20/2000

lib/maps:  got rid of the stuff that was there.  Useless stuff.
the maps dist. is the thing to use.  --PeterM


common/living.c, server/skill_util.c:  Patches by Garth Denley:
Fixes divide by zero crash, sets up perm exp when a new player is loaded,
seperates permanent exp code/calculations into another function.
checked in by MSW, 8/24/2000

lib/crossfire.png: ground/sea*png - remove transperancies from png images
since they should not be transparent.  MSW 8/23/2000

doc/spoiler.html/(Makefile.in,empty.pbm, makeps.pl, spoiler.html):  Modify
to make gif images from png source instead of xpm images.  A valid question
to ask is why convert to gif at all and not just keep in PNG format.  The
answer right now is that png support in netscape at least still is not very
good, and it displays gifs better.  MSW 8/8/2000

Add/Remove some LOG calls:
common/living.c:  Remove log messages about gen_sp values on armor
server/login.c, server/main.c: Add messages about player logins/logouts with
IP address.  Useful for tracking potentially troublesome players and where
they are player from.  MSW 8/7/2000

The following change basically does the following:  When the server sends an
item name to the client, this item name is now two pieces - the first piece
of the name is its singular form, the second piece is the plural name.  This
now makes items in the inventory appear more proper in terms of pluralization
and just normal English.  I did notice that the server does not know how
to properly make 'torch' plural - it turns it into torchs.  A matching
check in for the client has also been done.
include/newserver.h:  Update VERSION_SC to 1024
common/item.c: Change query_base_name to take a second option on whether
  we should generate a plural version of the name or not.
socket/item.c: Modify functions to use second argument on the query_base_name
  function.  Update item commands to send two part names (singular & plural).
  Modify esrv_send_look to use item1 protocol command instead of item command.
server/c_object.c: Update item_matched_string to use second option to
  query_base_name.  Modify function to check against both singular and
  plural versions of name.
server/shop.c: Modify shop_listing command usage in query_basename to use
  second option.  It will also generate the singular name, but that is only
  used on sorting, so I don't think it will generally cause any problems.
include/libproto.h:  rebuilt because query_base_name has an addition opt.
Mark Wedel 8/6/2000

include/config.h, include/global.h, common/init.c, common/living.c,
server/init.c, server/player.c, server/skill_util.c: Add permanent
experience and balanced stat loss features (code by Garth Denley).
Permanent experience make some experience in the skills permanent.  Balance
stat loss makes stat loss less likely/costly at low level and more costly
at higher levels.  These features are by default off, but can be turned
on either in the config.h file or via command line options.  Code checked
in by MSW 8/1/2000

server/time.c:  Update the change_object function such that if the object
is in a players inventory, send a delete & send_item for the object that
has changed (the delete + send_item is necessary due to the ways objects
change, so we just can't sent a update_item).  This fixes the 'torches
go dim & then out but client inventory not updated' bug, and likely fixes
some other problems - I am not sure how many other objects out there
change.  MSW 7/28/2000

random_maps/treasure.c:  potential crash bug fixed.  Only applied
when a bad archetype was given as a wallstyle.  I will also put
in a redundant archetypes fix. --PeterM 7/26/00

lib/adm/map_info, lib/adm/map_check:  Update to use new layout of installed
files (share/crossfire), know about random exits (it doesn't do any checking
to make sure the values are sane, which it probably should, but at least it
won't complain about them), update to use /usr/bin/perl.  MSW 7/25/2000

server/resurrection.c
include/spellist.h:  PeterM:  fixed a few unintended things about
resurrection:  experience removal was wrong, spellpoints/levels
changed.  --PetrM

lib/archetypes:  Update to keep in sync with arch tree.  Changes to
about a dozen arch's to remove the 'a' in their name.  MSW 6/27/2000

server/c_object.c: Fix command_drop which was doing incorrect check for
invisible object - it was supposed to skip over them and only do visible
objects, instead it was doing the reverse.  Fixes the 'drop command.
MSW 6/27/2000

server/input.c: Make the inventory command more robust for very long
object names - specify a maximum number of characters we will take from
the name.  Without this, you could get buffer overruns that cause crashes.
No normally generated items would ever likely have names long enough to
exploit this bug however.  MSW 6/27/2000

INSTALL, README:  Update mailing address to real-time address.  MSW  6/27/2000

server/login.c: Load and save usekeys value in player save file.  MSW 6/27/2000

Patch by Jeffry Hantin which fixes glow objects in map.
insert_ob_in_map_simple now will call the appropriate light updating code.
Applied by MSW 6/26/2000

server/player.c: check_pick():  Rewrite of this function to consistently
skip items that can't be picked up, and to only use a single loop over all
items on the map square.  - Jan Echternach 6/23/2000

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 0.95.6:

server/monster.c:  Patch by Neil Muller so that corrupt/bad @match entries
will not cause the server to crash.  Applied by MSW 6/21/2000

lib/archetypes: rebuilt for 0.95.6
lib/collect.pl:  Modify to search the archetypes directories in alphabetical
order - before I believe they were collected in basically inode order.
This should make it easier to multiple people to run the collect script
not have basically an entirely new archetyeps file.  MSW 6/21/2000

server/commands.c; server/c_object.c: dump_object_from_tag():  Removed
broken command.  Fixes server crashes very easily triggered by players.
- Jan Echternach 6/21/2000

server/attack.c: deathstrike_player():  Check for def_lev == 0 very early
(and print error message if we find such an invalid level).  Should fix
server crash in case archetypes or maps get broken again in that an
alive object has level < 1.  - Jan Echternach 6/21/2000

Makefile.in: Update version to 0.95.6
include/patchlevel.h: Update to .6 for 0.95.6 release
common/porting.c, include/config.h, include/loader.h, include/skills.h, 
include/spells.h, include/treasure.h, include/version.h, random_maps/style.c:
    Update my mail address and copyright date.  Mostly committed to sync
    up my data with the CVS repository - MSW 6/20/2000

random_maps/treasure.c server/apply.c:  made containers able to
have more than one treasure in them, made a fix to treasure.c, which would
change the options given to it in an unintended way.  --PeterM 6/20/2000


common/living.c: fix_player():  Bugfix: Don't reset FLAG_FLYING,
FLAG_REFL_SPELL, FLAG_REFL_MISSILE and FLAG_SEE_IN_DARK if the archetype
has these flags.  - Jan Echternach 6/19/2000


random_maps/*  Numerous changes improving random maps, including
two crash-fixes, a new type of 'special', ability to copy inventory
of monsters when putting them into maps...  --PeterM 6/19/2000

New naming scheme for random maps:  they won't grow in size
indefinitely anymore.  --PeterM 6/17/2000

server/input.c: command_cast_spell():  Bugfix: Call check_skill_to_fire()
even for wizards because this function has the important side effect
of setting the current skill and experience objects.
- Jan Echternach 6/19/2000

server/apply.c: apply_treasure():  Bugfix: We need to trigger runes as
they are found in the treasure chest, because move_rune() will no longer
trigger them for us.  - Jan Echternach 6/18/2000

Updated the INSTALL directions.  MSW 6/16/2000

Modified the editor to make certain objects (teleporters, creators,
markers) more easily editable.  --PeterM 6/16/2000

Modifed how firewalls worked.  They can now be triggered by
handles as well as turned.  Ones which are turned by handles
cannot be triggered by handles.  PeterM 6/15/2000

fixes to random_maps:
exit.c:  won't crash if named final_map doesn't exist
room_gen_onion.c:  reordered the options more sanely
special.c:  fixed a crash-bug:  nuke_map would nuke parts of monsters, but
not the whole monster.  --PeterM

server/skill_util.c:  Fix type in change_skill - was doing an == operation
when it should just have been an =.  MSW 6/13/2000

common/anim.c:  animation_object() - return if object does not have a valid
animation after logging error.  Before, we logged the error and would
promptly crash.  MSW 6/13/2000

server/apply.c: apply_treasure():  Bugfix: Set FLAG_NO_APPLY before
moving object to the top.  - Jan Echternach 6/13/2000

server/time.c: move_marker():  Bugfix: Call update_ob_speed() after
changing force->speed.  - Jan Echternach 6/13/2000

server/spell_util.c: move_swarm_spell():  Improved distribution of
fired objects.  Fixed starting position of fired objects to be able to
hit targets immediately in front the caster.  - Patch by Jeffrey Hantin,
applied by Jan Echternach 6/13/2000

server/disease.c, sproto.h, rune.c   Fixes from jhantin@derringer.net for diseases:
   Reversed strstr calls, force argument added to infect_object,
diseases in immune carrier last forever, needles use infect object,
cast_cause_disease won't fail.  --PeterM 6/9/2000

common/loader.l:  Fix handling of objects with no animation.  Fixes server
crash if object's archetype has an animation, but object doesn't.
- Jan Echternach 6/9/2000

common/loader.l: get_ob_diff():  Bugfix: Issue a "is_animated 0" line
if the object has an animation, but doesn't have FLAG_ANIMATE.
- Jan Echternach 6/9/2000

server/apply.c: manual_apply() and monster_apply_special():  Don't check
for FLAG_UNPAID if object is applied.  This should make the code more
robust if an unpaid item get's applied accidently.
- Jan Echternach 6/9/2000

server/apply.c: apply_special():  New optional flags AP_NO_MERGE and
AP_IGNORE_CURSE.  - Jan Echternach 6/9/2000

server/monster.c: find_mon_throw_ob(); server/skills.c: find_throw_ob():
Bugfix:  Use AP_NO_MERGE flag to prevent unapplied object be merged with
other objects.  - Jan Echternach 6/9/2000

server/spell_effect.c: animate_weapon:  Bugfixes: Correctly unapply
weapon.  Don't set FLAG_APPLIED directly on weapon in golem, but use
apply_special().  Don't call esrv_send_item() when caster is not a player
(fixes server crash if monster casts this spell).
- Jan Echternach 6/9/2000

random_map/<various>  Fixes in the map code for various things, including:  
1) crash bug on
multi-square monsters. 2)  no treasures in final_map, 3) new feature of doing
walls only, ....  --PeterM 6/9/2000:

common/button.c: do_mood_floor():  Bugfixes: Only players can have pets.
Call add_friendly_object() for friendly monsters.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/spell_effect.c and server/spell_util.c: Several functions:  Only
add a pet if there really is a pet's owner, and it's a player.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/spell_effect.c: cast_charm() and cast_charm_undead():  Bugfixes:
Only players can cast these spells.  This fixes server crash if
a monster casted a charm spell, and the charmed pet was killed.
Call add_friendly_object for friendly monsters.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

common/friend.c: remove_friendly_object():  Use llevError for error
messages.  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

common/living.c: fix_player(); server/gods.c: tailor_god_spell();
server/spell_effect.c: summon_avatar() and animate_weapon(): Bugfix: Set
a string to NULL after calling free_string().  This fixes a nasty bug
that caused the string's reference count drop below 0, which resulted
in corruption of malloc()'s internal data structures (and possibly
server crashes).  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/time.c: move_creator():  Bugfix: Call free_string() to free old
values of op->name and op->title before overwriting them with new values.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

common/object.c: insert_ob_in_map_simple() and insert_ob_in_map():
Check that we don't insert freed objects.  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/attack.c: hit_player_attacktype() and hit_player():  Bugfix: Check
that find_god() really found a god, and that 'god->slaying' is not NULL.
Fixes crash if a monster casted turn undead and actually hit something.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/attack.c: hit_player():  Check that a pet's owner is a player.
Prevents server crashes if a monster has a pet monster due to a bug
somewhere.  Use llevError for error message.  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/time.c: move_arrow():  Use llevDebug level for "Arrow had no
map" message.  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/c_object.c, server/spell_effect.c, server/spell_util.c:  Bugfixes:
Added some missing checks for destroyed objects.  Use was_destroyed()
or return value of insert_ob_in_map() to check for destroyed objects,
not FLAG_FREED or FLAG_REMOVED.  Don't use op->count of destroyed objects.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/shop.c: get_payment2():  Type of tag is 'tag_t', not 'long'.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/spell_effect.c: animate_bomb():  Fix environment checks.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/spell_util.c: fire_bolt():  Bugfix: Set level of bolt.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/spell_util.c: explosion():  Bugfix: Set FLAG_NO_APPLY before
moving the exploding object to the top.  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/spell_util.c: put_a_monster():  First create the monster
completely, then just insert its head.  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/time.c: generate_monster():  Bugfix: Don't free generators that
are used up in this function.  process_object() already does this.
This fixes steambolt (which is a generator but must not used up here -
generate_monster() wasn't looking at FLAG_IS_USED_UP) and all generators
which should really be used up (because process_object() didn't expect
generate_monster() to destroy the object).  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/rune.c: trap_disarm():  Bugfix: Use SK_level() to determine
disarmer's level.  Fixes server crash if multisquare monster casts
"disarm".  - Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/attack.c: hit_map():  Use was_destroyed() to properly check for
destroyed next object.  Use llevError for error messages.  Skip all
objects that are (no longer) at the specified map position.
- Jan Echternach 6/8/2000

server/map.h server/main.c Increased buffer sizes for map paths. 
Needed for random map code.  --PeterM 6/6/2000

6/4/2000:  Fix done to disease.c which causes diseases to 
put experience into the appropriate category.    --PeterM

6/4/2000:  Added race fields to a lot of monsters.  Modified
disease arcs so that they'll be specific to races.  Changed
include/spellist.h to re-enable the disease spells.  --PeterM

6/4/2000  (disease.c) Added a self-limiting parameter to diseases so
that their power can be tuned to be reasonable.  --PeterM

lib/crossfire.png: Some floors modified to no longer have transperencies.
include/newserver.h:  Add Send_Face_Png made, also update versions of
	the protocol
include/newclient.h:  Add CF_FACE_PNG constant.
socket/request.c: Add support for receiving PNG facemode request,
	ad final logic to send png images to the client.
Changes by Mark Wedel, 6/2/2000

lib/checkarch.pl:  Check for archetypes with type FIRECHEST but no level.
- Jan Echternach 5/29/2000

server/apply.c: move_apply(): Added handling of THROWN_OBJ, CANCELLATION
and BALL_LIGHTNING.
server/spell_effect.c: cancellation(): Traverse inventory of objects
with type THROWN_OBJ.
- Jan Echternach 5/29/2000

server/player.c: fire_bow() and server_skills.c: do_throw(): Bugfix: Don't
use op->count of freed objects.  Use was_destroyed() to check for freed
objects instead of QUERY_FLAG (FLAG_FREED).  - Jan Echternach 5/29/2000

server/spell_util.c: fire_a_ball(): Bugfixes: Use op->other_arch as
the archetype to fire, not FBULLET.  (-> Firechests now cast fire balls
again, not snowballs.)  Set level of fired archetype.  Check if object
was destroyed after insert_ob_in_map().  - Jan Echternach 5/29/2000

server/time.c: move_firewall() and move_firechest(): Do nothing if
object has no map.  Fixes server crashes if a dm creates such a thing
in the inventory.  - Jan Echternach 5/29/2000

lib/collect.pl:  Modify so that it does not complain about png files in the
arch directory MSW 5/28/2000

common/item.c:  Fix query_short_name - wasn't generating all item names
properly because of changes made a few days ago - some areas manipulate
the string being worked on and was not updating the length properly.
MSW 5/26/2000

doc/mapguide:  Fix some typos.  MSW 5/26/2000

include/define.h: Add MIN_ACTIVE_SPEED value to determine what threshold
something will be put on the active list or not instead of using
varying values throughout the source code.
common/item.c, common/object.c, server/monster.c, server/pets.c,
server/spell_effect.c:  Updated to use the MIN_ACTIVE_SPEED instead of
hardcoded values.  MSW 5/26/2000

include/define.h,include/global.h, common/image.c:  Remove following old
face information: INV_*_FACES, BLOCKED_FACE, STIPPLE[12]_FACE.  This
is just a general cleanup - the server has not used these since the
X11 code was pulled from the server.  MSW 5/26/2000

common/living.c: Add entries for the attack type AT_INTERNAL in description.
include/material.h: Update to include saves against INTERNAL attacktype.
include/living.h:  Remove defunct objects_saves external referance.
The additions of internal to the tables should not really be needed, as
internal attacktypes should not be used publically, but these also act as
placeholders for future attacktypes.  MSW 5/26/2000

* server/attack.c: hit_map(), hit_player(); server/spell_effect.c:
move_cone(); server/rune.c: spring_trap(); server/spell_util.c:
move_missile(): Bugfix: Added missing was_destroyed() calls.
* server/rune.c: spring_trap(): Bugfix: Call trap_show() before the rune
has a chance to be destroyed.
* server/attack.c: hit_map(), hit_player(): Check for freed objects
right at the beginning of the function.  Removed check that hitter has
a name from hit_player().
* server/spell_util.c: move_cone(): Bugfix: Remove cone objects in
inventories from active list, this fixes the cone without map problem when
a flower was hit with ice and put into an icecube.
* server/spell_util.c: move_missile(): Bugfix: Don't call hit_map() while
missile is removed from the map.
* server/apply.c: manual_apply(): Handle MMISSILE.
- Jan Echternach 5/26/2000

* server/spell_effect.c: animate_weapon() and server/spell_util.c:
summon_monster(): Bugfix: Set FLAG_FRIENDLY for friendly objects.
- Jan Echternach 5/26/2000

* server/attack.c: hit_player(): Bugfix: remove_friendly_object()
was called always after an object with type GOLEM had been killed,
but friendly objects are objects with FLAG_FRIENDLY, not objects with
type GOLEM.  This fixes some "Remove_friendly_object(): Can't find
object" errors.   - Jan Echternach 5/26/2000

-----------------------------------
--- BEGIN apply() cleanup patch ---  Jan Echternach 26/5/2000
-----------------------------------

* player specific code moved from apply() to player_apply() and
player_apply_below().

* apply(): null pointer check removed

* (bugfix?) print message if scroll is unusable because of invalid
spell number

* bugfix: if the altar casted a spell, the message was sent to the
(destroyed!) sacrifice, not the player

* split apply() -> move_apply() / manual_apply()

* move_apply(), check_walk_on(), insert_ob_in_map() and other functions:
New parameter 'originator' that is the object that caused another object
to be inserted into the map.  This removes the need to look through all
map objects above an altar to find the player who dropped the sacrifice.

* always check FLAG_UNPAID in manual_apply()

* don't check FLAG_UNPAID in apply_special(), new function
monster_apply_special() which checks FLAG_UNPAID and calls apply_special()

* many new functions like apply_altar() and apply_spellbook() to make
the switch statements in move_apply() and manual_apply() shorter

* changes to actual apply() code:

ALTAR:
  spell casting altars should work now if not operated by a player
  common/button.c, operate_altar(): altar's message is sent to altar's
    map, not player's map
  bugfix: if sacrifice was accepted, apply() didn't tell the caller
    that it has been destroyed
ARROW, CONE, FBULLET, BULLET:
  now returns 'victim destroyed' if victim was killed by the attack
TRAPDOOR:
  play sound only if something fell through the trapdoor
  print trapdoor message _before_ falling into trapdoor
TRIGGER_ALTAR (in check_trigger()):
  don't check for sacrifices if called from animate_trigger()
  don't call check_trigger() from fix_auto_apply() anymore (this change
    breaks maps with altars that have their sacrifice already stored on
    them)
DEEP_SWAMP:
  deep_swamp() -> walk_on_deep_swamp() / move_deep_swamp()
  when deep_swamp() (now move_deep_swamp()) is called from
  process_object(), assume that state (swamp->stats.food) is already 1
EXIT:
  removed support for multisquare players
  don't print 'is closed' message when moving on an exit, only print this
    message if exit is applied manually
SIGN:
  only increment last_eat if it hadn't reached the limit yet
SPELLBOOK:
  removed partial support for applying by monsters
BOW, WAND, ROD, HORN:
  moved code to apply_special()
CLOCK:
  bugfix: Monsters must not apply a clock, they would crash the server.
POWER_CRYSTAL:
  Bugfix? Don't call esrv_update_item() if not applied by a player.
LIGHTER:
  Bugfix? Just return 0 if not applied by a player.

* changes to apply_special():

BOW:
  remove double check_skill_to_apply()
ROD, HORN:
  change message from "you apply ..." to "you ready ..."

BOW: FLAG_READY_BOW is now set by apply_special(), but that seems
redundant because monster_check_apply() also sets this flag.  Remove
setting of this flag from apply_special() because it could have a
more complex meaning in monster.c or remove setting of this flag from
monster_check_apply() because such stuff should be handled in apply.c?
FLAG_READY_BOW is also unset in apply_special() if a bow is unapplied.

CONE:
  don't multiply damage by 20
SIGN:
  you can hear magic mouths even if you are blind
  however, now you can also read signs with FLAG_WALK_ON/FLAG_FLY_ON if you are
    blind
  (different object types or a new flag would be required)
RUNE:
  detonation moved from move_rune() to move_apply() -> runes will now always
    detonate if somebody steps on them
  allow runes with FLAG_FLY_ON

completely removed GRAVE and MONEY_CHANGER

common/object.c: was_destroyed(): new function
include/object.h: new typedef tag_t
move_apply() returns void, check_walk_on() uses was_destroyed()

lib/checkarch.pl:
  check for archetypes with walk_on, walk_off, fly_on or fly_off and without
    a type
  check for archetypes with type FIREWALL (type 62) and without a level

* server/apply.c: Bugfix: Don't skip calls to change_skill() if wizard -
calc_skill_exp() requires change_skill() to set the current experience object.

* server/monster.c: find_mon_throw_ob():  Bugfix: Unapply applied object even
if heaviest object was choosen.
Bugfix: Use monster_apply_special() to unapply, clearing FLAG_APPLIED isn't
enough. -> Should fix the "HAS_READY_BOW without bow" errors.
* server/skills.c: find_throw_ob():  Bugfix: Use player_apply(), clearing
FLAG_APPLIED isn't enough.
Replace redundant check for FLAG_INV_LOCKED with error message at end of
function if the first check failed somehow and we have choosen an object with
FLAG_INV_LOCKED.
make_throw_ob(): error message if object is applied

* lib/checkarch.pl: check that potions (type 5, POTION) have a level

* server/apply.c: apply_special(): Handle all cases of applying and unapplying
skill objects.
* server/apply.c: manual_apply(SKILL): Just call apply_special().
* server/skill_util.c: change_skill(): Rewrite to simply use apply_special()
for changing skills.

* server/apply.c: apply_special(): Bugfix: Fixed return values.

* server/skill_util.c: link_player_skills(): Bugfix: Don't set exp_obj for
(visible) skill tools.
* server/skill_util.c: link_player_skills(): Bugfix? Reset op->chosen_skill
and FLAG_READY_SKILL because we have unapplied all skills.
* server/input.c: legal_range(): Bugfix: range_skill is valid only if
op->chosen_skill != NULL, not when there is some (unapplied) skill somewhere
in the inventory.
* server/login.c: check_login(): Bugfix: call legal_range() after
init_player_skills() - we can't handle range_skill correctly if skills haven't
been initialized.
* server/login.c: check_login(): Bugfix: Check return value of legal_range(),
and reset op->contr->shoottype to range_none if range was invalid.
* server/login.c: check_login(): Bugfix: Don't call fix_weight() - fixing
the weight of _all_ players isn't necessary.  Just initialize op->carrying
directly with sum_weight() instead.  This also removes the problem of
updating the weight of an object that hasn't been sent to the client yet.
* server/login.c: check_login(): Bugfix: We need to call fix_player()
(init_player_skills() needs this, and it also makes the code more robust).

* server/apply.c: apply_altar(): Bugfix: Print altar's message before
casting the spell.

* server/spell_util.c: move_cone(): Use copy_owner() instead of set_owner()
and manually correcting the skill and experience object pointers.
* server/spell_util.c: cast_cone(): Don't set FLAG_FLYING - the archetype
needs to have this anyway for move_cone() to work properly.  Instead, print
error messages if FLAG_FLYING, FLAG_WALK_ON or FLAG_FLY_ON are missing.

* server/apply.c: move_apply(): TRAPDOOR: Bugfix: Multiply by op->nrof when
calculating the weight.

* randommaps/standalone.c, server/apply.c: fix_auto_apply(): Bugfix: Don't
call check_trigger() for objects of type TRIGGER.  For other trigger types,
call check_trigger() only if there is an object above the trigger.
This can be used to implement doors that are only open shortly after the map
has been loaded.
* common/button.c: check_trigger(): Many changes.  The triggers should now
behave as described in crossfire.doc.  -> This breaks maps that rely on old
buggy behaviour.

* server/monster.c: monster_apply_below(): will_apply & 1 now also applies
TRIGGER objects, not only HANDLE objects.  Allows an interesting solution for
/asyvan/gate9 if there is no second player who can open the middle grate.

* common/button.c: check_trigger(TRIGGER_PEDESTAL) and update_button(PEDESTAL):
Bugfix: Handle objects with heads correctly.

* server/c_object.c: drop_object() and socket/item.c: look_at(): Bugfix: If a
player is moved on top with remove_ob()/insert_ob_in_map(), FLAG_NO_APPLY must
be set temporarily.
* common/object.c: remove_ob(): Bugfix: Don't call move_apply_func() if
FLAG_NO_APPLY is set.

* server/apply.c: manual_apply(): Don't call apply_special() for objects
that are not in the inventory.  Return 2 in this case.
* server/apply.c: player_apply_below(): Skip objects for which manual_apply()
returned 2.

* server/apply.c: apply_spellbook(): Bugfix: Don't give experience for items
with FLAG_STARTEQUIP.

---------------------------------
--- END apply() cleanup patch ---  Jan Echternach 26/5/2000
---------------------------------

server/input.c:  modify examine_monster to use the maxhp field instead of
the arch hp field to determine healthiness of the monster.  Also, give
this information for all creatures, not just monsters or players.  
MSW 5/23/200

socket/item.c:  Add MAXITEMLEN define at top of file and use that to determine
    at what point item commands should be broken up.  Prior hard coded value
    was not always large enough.  MSW 5/23/2000

include/define.h:  add safe_strcat inline/static function.  Add
    DESCRIBE_ABILITY_SAFE and DESCRIBE_PATH_SAFE which use the safe_strcat
    to prevent buffer overuns.
common/item.c:  Have query_name use HUGE_BUF for its buffer - query_short_name
    uses that buffer size, and we call the same thing.  have quer_name and
    query_short_name use the safe_strcat function.  Increase buffer size
    in ring_desc to be a VERY_BIG_BUF and also use safe_strcat along with the
    DESCRIBE_*_SAFE macros.
server/input.c:  Modify examine.c to not get buffer overruns for very long/
    complicated items.  Modify long_desc to also handle long names/descriptions
    without buffer overruns.
socket/item.c:  Modify the functions that prepend the length to the name
    of the object to handle very long (>255) object names properly - now we
    just truncate it and only send the first 255 bytes.  add function
    add_stringlen_to_sockbuf to make this task easier.
With the above changes, very long named items/items with very long
descriptions works properly in both the server (no crashes) and the
client (no crashes/protocol errors)  MSW 5/22/2000

common/item.c: Modify query_short_name to avoid buffer overflow on long
ring descriptions.  Also, increased size of buffer in this function so
that longer ring descriptions will not get truncated.  MSW 5/22/2000

server/c_chat.c: Add standard banner to top of file.  Fix say command so
that it does not crash the server if something beyond 256 characters is
spoken - extra data is just truncated.  MSW 5/22/2000

common/object.c:  Splitted set_owner() into set_owner_simple() and
set_owner().  copy_owner(): New function.
server/spell_util.c: explode_object(): Use copy_owner() instead of setting
skill and experience objects manually.  Bugfix: Don't use op->owner
directly (fixed by using the caster in call to SP_level_dam_adjust(),
not the owner, which was wrong anyway).
server/spell_util.c: fire_arch_from_position(): Use copy_owner() instead
of set_owner() if 'op' isn't the real owner but only a spell object
owned by somebody else.
server/spell_util.c: move_swarm_spell(): Use the swarm spell object as
the owner in call to fire_arch_from_position(), which now handles this
case correctly.
server/spell_util.c: fire_swarm(): Call tailor_god_spell().
server/gods.c: determine_god(): op->type==SWARM_SPELL is a spell.
server/gods.c: tailor_god_spell(): op->type==SWARM_SPELL is a spell.
Always abort function if we couldn't find a god.  Always add god's
attacktype if the spellop's attacktype has AT_GODPOWER.
- Jan Echternach 22/5/2000

common/init.c, common/loger.c, include/logger.h, server/init.c:  New
log level llevInfo which is the new default log level.
Many other files:  Use llevInfo instead of llevError where appropriate.
Use 'settings.debug >= llevDebug' instead of 'settings.debug'.
- Jan Echternach 21/5/2000

server/main.c:  Use a marker object to track current position in the list
of active objects.  Using a pointer didn't work because all objects on
that list can be removed from it by process_object().  One of the things
this fixes is bogus "Free object on list" errors.
- Jan Echternach 21/5/2000

crossedite/Makefile.in:  Modify to use $(MAKE) instead of make when 
descending into subdirectories - fixes compilation on FreeBSD - MSW 5/17/2000

socket/init.c:  Fix incorrect check on return value from fread when
loading xpm images.  MSW 5/17/2000

Fix server/spell_effect.c - was assigning altar->other_arch to an object
and not archetype MSW 5/16/2000

server/spell_effect.c: magic_wall():  Duration of darkness spell now
implemented with op->stats.food.  This avoids problems with very low
speed values that were interpreted as infinite duration.
lib/spell_params:  Changed duration parameters of darkness spell to
give a reasonable duration with the new formula.
- Jan Echternach 16/5/2000

common/living.c: drain_stat():  There are 7 stats now, not 6.
- Jan Echternach 15/5/2000

server/rune.c: rune_attack():  Check that victim still exists after
hit_player() was missing.  This fixes server crashes if monster applied
a chest, found a diseased needle and was killed by it.
- Jan Echternach 15/5/2000

server/spell_effect.c: cast_charm():  out_of_map() check was missing.
This fixes server crashes when a player casted this spell near the
edge of a map.  - Jan Echternach 15/5/2000


Make image files and code more generic.  This was largely done to make
adding support for png files easier, but in reality, it means adding support
for any new file format is now trivially easy.  Format of the image
file is:
IMAGE <image num> <datalen> <image name>\n
followed by the image data.
This allows support for binary image formats (png), but also means that
the server doesn't need to know anything about the image format - rather
it is all just data as far as the server is concerned.  I think this
actuallyy loads the xpm data a little faster - it would make sense that
it should, since it just reads all the data in with one fread instead
of parsing it line by line waiting for the end image delimeter.
Note:  While png images are loaded, they are currently not supported
in the client nor will the server send them - that is the next step
in the work, but that will require just a few minor changes to the
server - most of those change will be in the client.

crossedit/xutil.c: Merge bitmap & pixmap load routine into one called	
    ReadImages, function modified to use above format.
crossedit/App.c: Call ReadImages to load images.
include/newserver.h: Change FaceInfo structure to have arrays of data
    and datalength instead of explicity entries for pixmap vs bitmap data.
lib/adm/make_xpm_file.pl, lib/crossfire.cfb, lib/xbmtobdf.c: Removed -
    either note needed or replaced by new naming scheme.
lib/adm/collect_images.pl:  Replacement/improvement of make_xpm_file.pl
    above - this handles all image formats (xbm, xpm, png).  This is
    also more intelligent in that it will not try to rebuild the image files
    if there is not a valid arch directory.
lib/crossfire.png, lib/crossfire.xbm (new files):  .png file is for png
    images.  xbm is to keep with the new standardized naming convention used
    and is for the bitmaps.
lib/crossfire.xpm:  New format used in file.
lib/Makefile.in:  Modified to collect via new script as well as new
    directives to collect (png files).
socket/init.c: Modified to load with the new format and data structures.
socket/request.c: Modified to send data with the new data structures
    provided.

End of image changes, MSW 5/13/2000

configure.in, configure:  Add check for perl so that we can call scripts
properly - MSW 5/13/2000

common/re-cmp.c:  Add some tolower calls in the comparisons so most
regular expressions should not be case insenstive (makes matches & says
work better).  Note that I did not change the behaviour on range matches
(Z-f for example), as I thought there may be side effects in that case.
MSW 5/8/2000

socket/request.c:  Add length checking to NewPlayerCmd so that if the client
sends us a really long command, we just truncate the end of it and not
overwrite our internal buffers causing crashes.  MSW 5/8/2000

server/player.c: add out_of_map check to stand_near_hostile function.  This
fixes a server crash if the player uses a hiding skill near the edge of a map.
MSW 5/8/2000

common/arch.c, common/loader.l (loader.c):  Modify the load routines
to strip off trailing whitespace in object names and other_arch fields -
I believe this is why altars to Sorig did not generally work, and while
generally that white space should not exist, doing a little extra checking
for it is not a bad idea - MSW 4/26/2000

Add HOLY_ALTAR type, and use that for praying over for gods and the
like.
doc/crossfire.doc:  Add description of HOLY_ALTAR type and meaning
	of fields.
common/map.c:  Disable consecration code for altars.
include/define.h: Add type for HOLY_ALTAR
include/sproto.h: Update for change of some functions below.
server/c_wiz.c:  Modify setgod command to call become_follower with
	proper second arg.
server/gods.c: Change become_follower to take object pointer to god instead
	of name, since the holy_altar has the pointer in its other_arch.
	Modify pray_at_altar to use the new fields, as well as fixed
	what seemed to be numerous bugs in that function.
sever/skills.c: Change check from ALTAR to HOLY_ALTAR, also change
	check to see if HOLY_ALTAR is consecrated by looking at the
	other_arch field.
server/spell_effect.c:  Update consecrate so that caster must be
	higher effective level than the altar, also update for
	differing fields.
maps/thomas/sisters/shrine0, map/thomas/sisters/tower0:  Remove
	title from altars on these maps - these were the only two maps
	using old style altars consecrated to a god.  Since it appears the
	real purpose of the altars on these maps was to trigger something
	else, they were kept as old style altars.
arch/gods/altars (relocated from arch/indoors, as I think the new
	location makes more logical sense):  Update for new fields/format.
	This also affects lib/archetypes, lib/bmaps.paths, lib/crossfire.xpm,
	lib/crossfire.cfb
lib/adm/archsearch.pl:  Modified to hunt out old archetypes - some of the
	changes could be useful in general cases.
MSW 4/26/2000

server/spell_util.c: Fix move_golem so that multi square avatars (golems)
don't hit themselves.  Remove will_hit_self function (only used in
move_golem), since it did not work.  Change structure & indenting of
move_golem function so it isn't quite so nested - functionality
remains the same.  When we do find something to kill in move_golem,
call attack_ob against it instead of hit_map - hit_map is not save
for multi object hitters.  MSW 4/24/2000

Key usage change:  Add new command 'usekeys' that specify how keys
are searched for. The three options are inventory, keyrings, and containers.
These options apply to both standard keys and special keys.  If the player
has a key for the door but it is in a container that will not be used,
print a friendly message of the key name and container name.  Files
affected:
help/usekeys: Added describing options
lib/Makefile.in: Addition of help/usekeys above.
include/player.h: Add new enumeration and entry into player structure
include/sproto.h: New function prototype
server/apply.c: change of Find_Key to new function with slightly 
	different options
server/c_misc.c: add function to support 'usekeys command.
server/commands.c: addition of usekeys command
server/player.c: rewrite & rename of find_key command, as well as changes
to move_player_attack
Mark Wedel 4/21/2000

server/spell_effect.c: create_bomb():  New spell_type parameter, merely
for consistency with itself and with other spell casting functions.
- Jan Echternach 4/19/2000

server/spell_effect.c: create_bomb():  Set level of created bomb.
Fixes the problem that the splints were casted without a level.
- Jan Echternach 4/19/2000

lib/checkarch.pl:  New perl script to check the archetypes file for
obvious bugs (like object that is alive but doesn't have a level).
- Jan Echternach 4/17/2000

include/spellist.h:  "meteor swarm" is now a missile spell (PATH_MISSILE)
just like "comet".  - Jan Echternach 4/17/2000

server/spell_util.c: path_level_mod():  Rewrote to fix countless bugs.
New interface with explicit base level parameter.
server/spell_effect.c: finger_of_death():  Call path_level_mod() with
correct base level.
server/spell_util.c: casting_level():  New function that combines
SK_level() with path_level_mod().
- Jan Echternach 4/17/2000

server/spell_util.c:  Several cosmetic changes (spell type parameter name
is spell_type, arch_to_object(get_archtetype(...)) is equivalent to
get_archetype(...), use casting_level() if applicable).
- Jan Echternach 4/17/2000

server/spell_util.c: fire_swarm():  New 'caster' parameter because
owner and caster can be different.  Level of the swarm object is casting
level of the caster, not overall level of the owner.
server/spell_util.c: fire_arch_from_position():  Set level of fired
arch to casting level of caster.
server/spell_util.c: cast_cone(), cast_smite_spell(): Set level of spell
object to casting_level() and not SK_level() to honour path_attuned and
path_repelled of the caster.
server/spell_util.c: move_cone():  Just copy the level for new cone
objects.

Missing level meant AT_DEATH didn't work, missing call to
path_level_mod()/casting_level() meant path_attuned/path_repelled was
ignored.  - Jan Echternach 4/17/2000 

server/player.c: fire_bow():  Set level of fired arrow.  Arrows with
AT_DEATH are now working.  - Jan Echternach 4/17/2000 

server/player.c: fire():  Call check_skill_to_fire() even for wizards
because this function has the important side effect of setting the current
skill and experience objects.  - Jan Echternach 4/17/2000 

server/skills.c: do_throw(), server/time.c: stop_arrow(), server/player.c:
fire_bow():  Flying arrows and thrown objects have FLAG_NO_PICK set because
picking these objects is currently broken (and maybe it shouldn't be
possible anyway - picking up a _flying_ arrow?).  - Jan Echternach 4/17/2000 

server/c_wiz.c: set_god():  Didn't work at all because it was trying to
set the current player as his own god.  - Jan Echternach 4/17/2000 

server/map.c: check_path():  Return value was wrong if the name did not
refer to a regular file.  A symptom of this bug was that the server crashed
if a wizard tried to enter a directory with the 'goto' command.
- Jan Echternach 4/17/2000 

server/map.c: open_and_uncompress():  Check that the file we have opened
is (still) a regular file, fail if it's not.  This is the right place
for such checks if we want to avoid race conditions (e.g. file replaced by
directory while trying to open it).  - Jan Echternach 4/17/2000 

c_party.c commands.c daemon.c disease.c gods.c spell_effect.c spell_util.c:
Cosmetic fixes - updates to rcsid string to include right file name as well as
updates to mail address and/or additions to top banner.  Mark Wedel 4/13/2000

Various files:  Updated my mailing address to be accurate - Mark Wedel
4/13/2000

doc/playbook/handbook.idx:  Automatically generated file removed.  This
is not something normally included in packed up distributions, so no reason
to have it in CVS - Mark Wedel 4/13/2000

doc/include_html.pl, doc/playbook/make_index.pl, doc/spoiler-html/makeps.pl,
lib/adm/make_xpm_file.pl:

Change to use /usr/bin/perl instead of /usr/local/bin/perl - real change is to
find perl in configure.in and call the scripts with that.  Mark Wedel
4/13/2000


server/input.c:  Don't try to calculate spellpoint costs for denied spells,
because these are undefined and are now causing lots of BUG messages.  Also
improved formatting: spellpoint costs can be > 99, and don't fill everything
with zeros, use spaces instead.  Patch by Jan Echternach, applied & checked in
by Mark Wedel, 4/12/2000

server/skill_util.c:  Fixed some log messages that were lacking a newline at
the end.  SK_level():  Rewrite of this function to simplify its structure.
Print error message if we find an invalid level.  Add top copyright/contact
banner (msw) Patch by Jan Echternach, applied & checked in by Mark Wedel,
4/12/2000

server/apply.c, server/monster.c:  Fix in apply.c for encounter maps
so that proper message is generated, and differentiate behaviour if it
is a floor vs not a floor.  Also, change to both files in that apply_below
stops at the floor object.  Patch by Jan Echternach, applied & checked in by
Mark Wedel, 4/12/2000

server/apply.c, doc/crossfire.doc:  Fix to prevent server crashes when monster
applies poison object.  doc file is updated to include accurate information on
values in poison object.  Patch by Jan Echternach, applied & checked in by
Mark Wedel, 4/11/2000

CREDITS, server/main.c:  Add Peter Gardner to list of credits.
Mark Wedel 4/4/2000

server/apply.c, improve_armour():
Maximum armour value reduced to 90.  Items can now always be improved up
to this value.  For armour x you need level x, not level x + 1 as before.
esrv_send_item() and fix_player() also called if only magic value was
improved.  Patch by Jan Echternach, applied & checked in by Mark Wedel,
4/4/2000

server/attack.c, attack_message():
More messages.  "grind to dust" is more damage than "shred to pieces".
Patch by Jan Echternach, applied & checked in by Mark Wedel, 4/4/2000

server/spell_effect.c, magic_wall():
Fix calculation of duration of darkness spell.  Before, you could get
huge negative speed values with high experience levels, which meant very
short duration.
Patch by Jan Echternach, applied & checked in by Mark Wedel, 4/4/2000

server/spell_util.c:
1) New argument of fire_swarm() to specify whether it's a magic attack.
All swarm spells except meteor swarm are now magic (just as the
underlying basic spell).
2) New function fire_arch_from_position() which doesn't use the owner's
position as the starting position of the fired arch.
3) move_swarm_spell(): Correctly set owner and magic in call to
fire_arch_from_position().
4) Above changes fixes "cause many wounds" spell
Patch by Jan Echternach, applied & checked in by Mark Wedel, 4/4/2000


common/map.c: Change calls in file to use insert_ob_in_map simple.
This fixes bugs with buttons not being applied correctly when the map
is loaded - the cause is that push_button is getting called for the
button before all the objects the button is linked to have been loaded.
Then when the map finishes loading, the call to update_button is called
and they are not in sync.  This change should make loading slightly faster,
mostly because it does not call check_walk_on during the loading, so that
buttons don't get pushed/changed around.  Mark Wedel 3/28/2000

server/player.c:  If player is using pickup mode 6, only have them pick up
the item if they know it is magical.  Prior to change, items would be
picked up if they are magical, but not if the player knew that, so the code
was giving extra knowledge to players.  Bug reported by Kurt Fitzner,
checked in by Mark Wedel, 3/26/2000

common/map.c:  Code fix by Kurt Fitzner so that unique maps will get
compressed if so needed.  Fixes problem of unique maps not being
able to get reloaded as they are saved with the compress suffix but
not in compressed form.  Code checked in by Mark Wedel, 3/26/2000

server/skills.c, server/spell_effect.c: Improve behaviour when identifying
items - the identify routine already updates the client if it is
in the players inventory, so only send update to client if the item is
on the map.  Also, do full item update, as many fields may change, and
that is what the identify function does.  Standard top of
file banner also added to skills.c file.  Fixes problem of
objects in inventory being displayed with two numbers in from
(ie, two two bows +1).
Bug and initial fix of item updates by Kurt Fitzner, 
implemented in a bit different way by Mark Wedel.  3/26/2000

Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in: Modified so that making the docarchive
now works.  The make must be done from the top level for it to work, since
some values are passed, but the doc/Makefile.in was missing some declarations
and had some other fixes that needed to be done.  msw 3/22/2000

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 0.95.5:

Makefile.in: comment out the EXTRA_FLAGS (which contains the -Wall
entry) - the presumption that everyone is going to use gcc to compile
crossfire is a poor one, and -Wall is only supported on gcc.  I would
rather have it compile on the maximum number of systems without it
needing changes than to require the end user to make the customizations.
A better long term solution is to have configure.in check for gcc or
if -Wall is supported it and have it add it in.  msw 3/21/2000

server/c_object.c: Fix pick_up_object function to deal with non players
picking up objects - prior to fix, program would crash when monsters
pick up objects.  Also, add standard banner at top of file about
copyright, contact, version information.  msw 3/21/2000

CREDITS, README: Updated to contain my new mailing address.  In reality,
almost all the files have an out of date address for me, but these
are probably the ones people will look at most.  README also updated
with new ftp location.  msw 3/20/2000

include/Makefile.in: Update files to include material.h - need when
packing up new releases - msw 3/20/2000

doc/hanbook.ps, doc/spoiler.ps, doc/spoiler-html/spoiler.html:  Rebuilt with
latest version of crossfire - not sure if there are any content changes, as
the tools to build the file have been updated on my system, causing many
changes to the prologue and outputted data. - msw 3/20/2000


Change doc/spoiler-html/Makefile.in and doc/playbook-html/Makefile.in to use
$(datadir) instead of $(C_LIBDIR). Other add AWK and INCDIR lines so that it
properly builds with autoconf setup. msw 3/19/2000

Change spoiler.tex, handbook.tex to build properly with later versions
of tetex - added language specifier when using the babel package.
msw 3/19/2000

Add missing doc/playbook/fig directory to the CVS reposistory -
msw 3/18/2000

Change summon_cult_monster code so that it will no longer summon big monsters
on top of walls or the player.  Also, if there is not space for a big
monster, try to find another pet monster that will fit in the space.
File affected: server/spell_effect.c - msw

Change gorokh.arc to use anim devil instead of anim Lucifer - fixes crash
when using avatars of gorokh - msw

Split off kill_player function from do some living, and check for player
death upon player login.  This splits up an otherwise very large function,
but more importantly, the second point allows NOT_PERMADEATH to work as
expected when the player is dead when logged out.  Previous, the if the
player was dead when they logged out, it would just kill off the character
permanently (without grave marker or anything), even in NOT_PERMADEATH
mode.  Also, cleaned up player load code to remove code that supported
very old style save files.
Files changed: server/login.c server/player.c include/sproto.h - msw

Change NO_STAT define in living.h,skillist.h,skill_util.c to NO_STAT_VAL
to remove conflict on AIX systems. - msw

Fix error in configure.in - was referancing BZIP2, when it should have
used BZIP - msw 2/7/2000

server/skill_util.c: Fixed spelling of unwield
configure.in: Update -z checks to not use eval, double quote the variable.
This seems to be needed on solaris and probably other systems.

---END OF BATCH UPDATE--- DAMN 9/17/1999

Add crossfire.oc.humbug.org.au server information to README file - msw

Change compress method definitions from being determined by checks
on system type to having autoconf find the utilities for us.  Also, add
bzip2 support. Files affected: Makefile.in configure.in common/map.c
server/init.c server/login.c include/config.h include/define.h
include/autoconf.h.in - msw

Fix in server/rune.c - if the victim of a trap/rune is not on a map
and the object has a disease, it would crash the server.  Temporary
fix put in to make sure there is a map, and if not, use a predefined
difficult of 1.  I think the real issue is how can an object not on a map
be setting a trap (in this particular bug, reported by Klaus Elsbernd,
the victim was a thrown object) - msw

Change by dragonm@absolut.tegris.org - improve crossedit so that if you
try to load a map you alreay have in memory, it will raise the window - 
it will also give you the option to forget, save changes, or just raise
the window if the in memory version of that map has been modified.  Checked
in by msw. (crossedit, App.c, Edit.c, Edit.h)

Bugfix in server/apply.c - apply_container()
  When checking for keys to locked containers, only searched player's
  inventory, not keyrings.  Changed to use FindKey function in player.c,
  which does search keyrings.
  --DAMN

Bugfix in server/main.c - enter_exit()
  Unique maps were using their actual location as a path for moving to
  a new map.  They need to use the location of the original map, not
  the character's individual copy of it.  This is re-constructed from
  the individual map's filename, which is based on the original path.
  --DAMN

Remove xbmtobdf man page - since it is run automatically and it is likely
that people will not run it manually (and it appears to be innacruate - or
at least imcomplete), may as well remove it.  - msw

Change install location of man pages to section 6 instead of section 1 - msw

New man page submitted by Egbert Hinzen that is actually correct and
accurate as the options now relate to crossfire. - msw

    This one is a suggested fix for the alchemy bug that grants obscene
    amounts of experience for certain formulas.  Those formulas are the ones
    that create items with a high fixed level, because those items are
    pretty worthless otherwise.  Dust of Repelling Undead, for example, is
    level 30.
        The fix I implemented here is to base the chance of success largely
	on the level of the product, so it's very difficult to produce
	something like Dust of Repelling Undead, and therefore worth the
	extra experience.  The chance of success is now based on the
	following factors:
	1) level of product
	2) number of ingredients in formula
	3) rarity of formula as listed in "formulae" data file
	4) number of batches being made
	5) Alchemy skill (if present)
	6) enchantment of cauldron
	7) luck

patch from DAMN
This one makes a couple things level dependent that used to be fixed:
1) time it takes Word of Recall to take effect
2) amount of energy transferred by Transferrence spell
3) percentage of energy drained by Magic Drain spell

Also, the following effects have been modified:
1) Followers of a cult that considers undead enemies have a penalty to
Command Undead.
2) Magic Drain gives back to the caster a small portion of the energy
drained from the victim.

And a bug was fixed:
1) SP_level_dam_adjust used and SP_level_strength_adjust used the
player's level, where they should have used the caster's level.
  --Patches from DAMN, applied by PeterM

Marker object added, alchemy modified so that recipes
can require keycodes and MARKS to execute, detectors modified
to be able to detect MARKS, and all of this documented in
crossfire.doc  --PeterM

server/gods.c  --  changing gods now costs players their special
			prayers. --PeterM
server/alchemy.c  --  levels less than ten no longer produce
		cursed items, but only slag or nothing.  --PeterM
server/shop.c  --  unidentified stuff is worth at most 60gp or so. 
  ---PeterM

random_maps/style.c - fix type in the scandir function which cause
compilation problems for those systems that actually need it. - msw

Change command_cast_spell so that it preserves a return value from
find_spell.  This re-enables partial spell matching (ie, cast prot
will show all spells that start with that.) - msw

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change for 0.95.4:

Add better comment in config.h about the DM_MAIL option - msw.

Fixed and doc/playbook/Makefile.in doc/spoiler/Makefile.in so it works with
autoconf setup.

Updated to properly generated handbook.ps when needed - msw

doc/crossfire.doc: Updated with disease code notes, detector notes.

crossedit:  Fix in edit.c to ensure map objects (mainly is_floor objects)
are actually removed visually as well as from a pure object standpoint.

Change to save_throw_object:  If object is in players inventory and
is destroyed, send update to client.  This can happen when trying to
ignite something in the inventory with flint and steel - msw.

In apply_lighter, do more accurate check when seeing if the attempted
object was actually destroyed.  Also, cache the item name so that if
it is destroyed, we have a proper name to print out. - msw

fireborns changed to have Pow stat bonus instead of Wis
stat bonus.  --PeterM

Some problems in the random map code fixed: specificially,
  1)  fountains no longer attempted placement outside map
  2)  Ignore files/dirs named CVS when looking for styles.

I changed a few of the maps to have exits to random maps.
I made one random house in Scorn, one random exit in the Hall of Bones
to an undead maze, another exit to a random map in the hole SE of
Scorn, and one in the bottom of the Tower of the Stars. --PeterM


Update lib/Makefile.in to create empty bookarch and temp.maps files as
part of install process. - msw

Change configure.in script so that by default, files will be put in
installdir/var/crossfire and installdir/share/crossfire instead of
just installdir/var and installdir/share.  This allows crossfire to be
installed more cleaning without it having its own top level directory.
Old installation behaviour can be gained by using --enable-old-layout when
running the configure script. - msw

Patch by Carsten Pluntke that fixes a problem with unique maps not being
properly reloaded after being swapped out (main.c) - msw

Fix so that when picking up objects from a container, the client gets
an update to remove the object display from the container (ie, if
you pick up all the gold coins from a container, the total in the players
inventory always got corrected, but the client still displayed some in the
container even if there should not be.)  The change is in c_object.c - msw

Check that hitter has a valid name before it attacks - fixes some
crashes (attack.c) - msw

Enhance lib/collect.pl to ignore CVS directories - msw.


Improve auto_apply functions so that it will create treasures (random_*
items) inside other objects.  There is still a limit in that it will only
look for these objects inside other top level objects - a random potion
inside a chest inside a monster will not be processed.  But that
should be a rare case, and nesting containers very deep has never been
well supported in the code.  The code affects is in the apply.c file. -msw

Add Xaw to start of libraries when linking crossedit - fixes focus problem.
File affected configure.in - msw

Fixed a bug in the "depletion on death" code.  The depletion
never had any stat removal specified.  --PeterM

Remove berzerk code/variable from player structure.  The code had
no effect - whatever functionality it once had has been removed in the
past. - msw


Add flag save information for FLAG_CLIENT_SENT that was otherwise
missing (loader.l).  This fixes the disappearing archetype bug - msw


Fixed buffering bug in lowlevel.c
  --David

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.95.2 to 0.95.3:

Fixed missing god animations in the archetypes.

SIMPLE_EXP option added.  From config.h:
 * Define this if you want to use the new (0.95.3) experience system.
 * The system has the following changes:
 *
 * 1) 2000 exp need for second level.  All additional levels are shifted
 *  accordingly.
 * 2) Your stats in your skill categories don't affect the amount of
 *  exp you get.
 * 3) Your level difference doesn't affect the exp you get for killing
 *  monsters.
 *
 * If this commented out, you get the old system.
 *
 * This can also be set by using -simple-exp/+simple-exp as a run
 * time option.


Change treasure lists so that stat improving potions won't show up in
shop.  They should still show up on the ramdom_potion spaces on the
maps (may in fact be slightly more common there than before)

Move socket related code out of server directory and into socket directory
and re-arrange cod so that what is in what file makes more sense.

Code from Peter Mardahl to have death result in stat depletion and
not actual stat loss.  Setable by via STAT_LOSS_ON_DEATH option in config.h
or -stat_loss_on_death/+stat_loss_on_death command line
options.

Patch by Peter Mardahl to change immunity spells from PATH_PROT to PATH_NULL
- this will stop gods from giving out these spells.

Patch by Peter Mardahl so that players will never fumble the reading
of scrolls.  You only get half as much exp for reading the scrolls now
however.

Update the README file - the list of public servers was grossly out of date
and mostly removed.  The instructions for running/playing were out of date,
containing information for servers with the old X11 code.

Change CAN_MERGE so that identified items with different been_applied 
will merge (this is currently done by just setting the been_applied flags
for the object in CAN_MERGE if they have been identified)

Temporary fix for disease code - I was seeing endless loops in weight
contributions because an disease object op->env points back at itself.
In do_symptoms, we check to see if the victim matches the disease we
are about to infect them with, and if so, don't proceed further.  The
cause of this pointer recursion needs to be found instead of
this current fix.

Change daemon.c so that hpux systems can also use ioctl (.., TIOCTTY, ..)
call in addition to SYSV systems.

players and logs command added.  players show all current player names
currently in use, logs show sockets that are currently listening for
kill log information.  Add limited support for some commands from
the socket (hiscore, logs, maps, motd, players, version, who).
After socket has been authenticated to have valid server, shout and tell
also available.  To switch socket into old style mode, first command
entered should be 'oldsocketmode'.  Server code then knows not to
prepend packet length information, so most functions work on this new
socket without any changes.

Add verify_player function to login.c (takes name and password and verifies
they are ok - used for old socket emulation).  Also notify all
players when a player joins the game (this must have gotten removed
at some point).

change prototype for cs_write_string to take a constant string.  In
readpacket, have it read in 100 bytes even if length information looks
incorrect (allows easier initial switching to oldsocketmode).  If
the length of the input buffer is for some reason negative, call abort.

Clean up nconns in socket.c - it was being increased 2 times when
a socket was added, and decreased by 2 when a socket was removed.
Add newline to initial version command so people telneting in for
old socket compatibilty get something a little more presentable.
command char pointer added to newsocket structure - used for player
name or listener html address.  Fix in memory overrun/corruption when
freeing the last allocated socket - it would write data beyond the allocated
data.

if new_draw_info is called to notify everyone, also notify sockets
running in old mode if it isn't a kill log listener.

Update commands.h file so that it won't declare various values if included
multiple times - only the first time it is included will it declare the
values.

Add extern declaration for init_sockets to global.h since other functions
now need to access them.

Who command extended to also show active socket connections without a player
attached.

Kill log (watchable from socket) added.

Add support to use old socket commands on the new port.

Fix by Seikoh Nishita for weapons that slay multiple creatures - before
fix, they would not slay anything (args to strstr were reversed)

Don't give out exp for orating to monsters owned by another player - fixes
abuse since 2 players could quickly orate back and forth and gets lots of
exp.  The orate function was also cleaned up a bit to be more efficient
(presumption is made that there is only 1 monster on any one space, so once
we find one, there is no need to do further processing)

If door is passable, print a message to the player if he tries to
pick the lock and don't let them pick it (examples here are the
doors which you can walk through)

Fix by Seikoh Nishita that should prevent some crashes when exiting
shops - appears that there could be circumstances when i was trying
to referance a null pointer in an error message.

Add popen_local for sgi systems - without this, sgi can only open one
compressed map before it fails to open further compressed maps.

Fix by Timo Kokkonen so that resurrection works with the new player
save method.  This should also fix the problem that dead players when
using PERMADEATH being able to log in after dying.

Allow FORCE objects to increase digestion/hp/sp/grace regeneration.

Remove style.h file, since we now have an automatically generated proto file
from random directory source.  Also fix in makefine to use proper ar
when creating the archive.

Add 'race *' to maps/styles/misc/fountains - this fixes a crash when
entering random maps.

If use presses an incorrect key at the play again prompt, reprint the 
play again question.

Change find_free_spot to return -1 if no spot available, update calls so
check for this return value instead of 0 (value = means current spot
available)

Change pet movement so that pets should no longer jump walls.

Update configure, makefiles, and code to use proper locations of installed
files (no longer $prefix/lib, instead $prefix/share for read only,
and $prefix/var for read/write.

When using a special key to open the door, print a message informing the
player what key was used to open the door.

Minor map cleanups/changes.  Some improper exits changed to point the
right place, extraneous style maps removed due to new gods, other maps
updated to replace now missing altars with their replacements.

Change gate code logic so instead of using speed to determine if the object
can move itself, we instead check the ALIVE flag (this fixes problems for
animated objects, and is a more accurate method in any case.)

Fix by S.Nishita so that containers on the ground get properly unapplied
when player moves off them.

Fix by S.Yoshioka's so that damage for cone spells is calculated properly
as they propogate.

Remove server side referances to INFOLINES and INFOCHARS, since that is now
controlled by the client.

Code cleanup to random map generator to prevent compiler warnings.  
Also, change comparision of val == 0x1 to val-1 = null, since the
later is more portable.

added some missing newlines to log messages in the newsocket.c file.

fix pickup modes some - mode 4 appeared to work ok (pickup all), but mode
5 wasn't working right (pickup all and stop).  I have tested the modes
with the X11 client, and they all appear to work properly.

House of Healing map (with link from starting city) added by Peter Mardahl.

Change player move code so you will no longer swap spaces with a pet
monster/other friendly object is you are braced.

Fix off by one error in the buffering socket buffering code - this would
cause buffer overflows if the data being added equaled exactly the buffer
size+1.  Similar fix when reading in packets

Increase NROFATTACKS to 24 in define.h so the AT_INTERNAL attacktype
work properly.

Patch by S.Yoshioka so that godpower/holyword spells are not magical.

Fix in attack.c by S.Yoshioka to call free_object instead of free for
splitting monsters.

Fix by S.Yoshioka so that magic bullet or other pure magic spells do
damage to other parts of multisquare monsters.

Fix by S.Yoshioka so that you can not get exp in other skills with cone
spells.

Fix by Seikoh Nishita so that magic walsl can not be placed on top of
other walls/monsters.

Fix by Seikoh Nishita so that we don't clear the NO_STEAL flag on 
insert_ob_in_map - this makes singing/stealting from the same monster
multiple times impossible.

Patch by Seikoh Nishita so that boulders will roll off gates.

Have server send updated weight of container when dropping all items from
a container.

New random map decore styles for new religions added.

Patches from James Cameron to fix compile errors/warnings.

Fix missing animations for some of the gods.

Remove *.orig files from maps/picks directory.

Maps updated wtih dtabb 2.60, navar_city 2.40 maps from John Cater.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.95.1 to 0.95.2:

speed_left values should not be changed when loading/saving maps with the
editor.

Map updates from Anthony Tyson and others (990128 version)

Note:  I was unable to reproduce the staff to snake killing the client bug.
If still in this client/server release, please let me know.

Set player->count in esrv_move_item when picking up objects.  This fixes
a bug introduced in 0.95.1 for the improved pickup code which only allowed
picking up of all the objects on the ground.

lifesaving items should now disappear from client inventory after they
are used.

Improve decrease_ob_nr so that items dropped on the ground will get removed
from the players inventory if they are used up (fixes bug where you drop
the last of some item on an altar but it would not disappear from your
inventory)

Add check to add_exp so that we don't add experience to non living creatures.
This should fix the thrown objects getting lots of speed bug.

Random map code by Peter Mardahl added.  Various changes made so it will
compile on non gcc systems as well as non bsd systems.

Another fix for pits (holes) so objects should drop through.  The fix
in the last release made fixed a possible infinite loop, but also made
it that once an object on the pit could not drop through, no other objects
on the pit would drop through.  The change made will attempt to drop all
objects through the pit, but also not run into a problem with infinite loops.

Update pedestal and detector code to also match on the lockcode of the
special keys.

Change detector function to call push_button instead of update_button.
The later would only change the state of buttons, which doesn't do much
good when you want to open a gate.  push_button will cause gates and
other connected objects to open.

Change move_gate so that it won't roll off things like grass or other
immovable objects.

Update configure script to check for scandir function (needed by disease
code) - if not found, then check in -lucb.

Disease code from Peter Mardahl added.

add break value in while loop in generate artifact message (readable.c) so
we eventually break out if no match is found.

reduce minimum supported map size in crossedit to 1x1

Don't let characters be easily saved on unholy ground.  Player can't issue
'save' command when on unholy ground, and we don't autosave if on unholy
ground.

Improve pickup code mode 6 (pickup magic item) - call is_magical to
determine if an item is magical instead of relying on known_magical flag.

If the player has a marked item in need of identifying, identify that 
specific item first when an apply altar is used.  This allows a player
to selective choose what to identify.

Fix in apply code between server and client.  Containers on the ground
now work properly.  Server side simplified a bit, and updated to be a bit
more bandwidth efficient (use update item to open/close containers.)  Client
updated to handle updating its container status via the update commands.

Fix in pay_for_item in that it will not mistake kobans or other coins for
gold coins when making change (or converting the older coins into new
coins with the same arch but with a different value)

Have player swap places with pet monster even if player no longer has peacful
set.

At confirmation when player quits, inform them that quitting will delete
the chararacter.

When a weapon is improved by the god, if it had no prior attactkype set,
give it physical attacktype in addition to what the god gives it.

By default, make new players peaceful.

Fix up the fire cancellation function - it seems some of the code wasn't
quite right (inserting in map vs setting the owner.)  The fix should 
prevent some core dumps this could have caused.

Fix for main loop in socket.c that should prevent infinite loops when
a socket dies in some improper way.  It should now drop the connection
properly and continue with processing.

Autoconf fixes - check for canonical system, specail check for
alpha-dec-osf to add -std1 to cflags, add check for latex, add check
for BOURNE_SHELL (this is used in hte makefiles, as some os's will use
the users shell, but some constructs we use require bourne type shell), 
add check for number of args gettimeofday uses, change order when
we create the makefiles to be proper.

Use autoconf check above to get correct number of args for gettimeofday.

Fix from  Anthony Thyssen for the editor - should hopefully fix problem with
delete not deleting the correct object.

Remove font displaymode from editor - since we are not distributing any
fonts anymore, doesn't make a lot of sense to support it.

When connection is lost from player, save off the character - prevents
items being dropped on the floor or the players duplicating the items.
However, some additional logic will need to be added to prevent players
from saving their characters in treasure rooms.

Improvements in save_player which should better prevent saves from
happening at inopportune times (like after they have mostly exited).

Add stat_loss_on_death option (yes/no if stat is subtracted when you die.)
Default can be set in config.h, and can also be changed with run
time flags.

Add / behind -I@x_includes@ in crossedit/Makefile.in.  This should prevent
the includes from being reset if there are no x_includes.

Extend draw_look to send multiple item commands - this should only happen
if there are a lot of items on one square.  Fix should prevent crashes/memory
corruption in that case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.95.0 to 0.95.1:

Fix server crash if player ran into friendly object.

Strip extra spaces that may be between the command and option (ie,
"use_skill  disarm" would result in " disarm" getting passed to the appropriate
command function.  Some functions could deal with this, others did not,
and it makes sense to strip them out.

Send update to client to remove item from players inventory when it
disintegrates (demon ichors for example).

Change load code so that player handling on unique maps should work better
(I believe there were various strange cases if the player saved on a
per player unique map and that map was or was not in memory, it might not
load the per player unique map)

Removed player file lockin during login.  Extra lock files get left 
laying around in aborted login attempts.  And in retrospect, I don't
think it is ever really needed.

Some excessive/annoying debugging messages removed.

Some general cleanup in some functions that were previous setting
automatic variables.  If the variables are none changing, we now declare
them static, otherwise we don't set the value as the initialization 
area - this prevents warnings with some compilers.  Some casts added for
some functions to also prevent warning messages.

Remove HAVE_SAVE_UID in config.h - no longer any code using it.

In free_player, only call remove_ob on pl->ob if it is not already removed.
This fixes crashes when a player kills there login session before 
it is completed.

Instead of calling draw_look (which causes all data on that space being
sent to the client) each time the space changes, instead mark that we
need to send that change, and have code higher up (top processing loop)
send the data each tick if it needs to be send.  This should result in less
data being sent, and is easier to process.

Add flag_client_sent for debugging purposes - makes it much easier to
trace down cases where server was sending updates without actually having
sent the object yet.  Most all of those cases are fixed with the new draw_look
logic mentioned above.  Add dump_object_from_tag to figure help figure out
the objects generating messages.  dumptag command is available from within
the game if compiled with DEBUG to use this fucntion.

Pup land maps updated to version 1.3.

Fixes in configure script to autodetect X11 libraries better.  Fixes
also in Makefiles so all rules should work and all needed variables should
now be expanded.  Add checks for a few more header files.  Makefile fixes
also include changes so that archive is packed in proper order that it should
not try to rebuild pregenerated files.  Master makefile now set to 
make bzip2 archives in addition to gzip archives.

Added watchdog code from Christian Stieber - periodically sends out UDP
packets so other programs can watch for them and restart the server if it
doesn't see them (hung or down server).

Added ISQRT macro to spell_effect.c - seemed that the code was changed
a while back but that function wasn't added.  It was only needed of
SPELL_FAILURE_EFFECTS is compiled in as an option.

Simplify checking of MAXNAMELEN in crossedite/include/Posix.h

Updated list of options you get when you do -help - removed old options that
are no longer around and added new ones.

Dropping an active container will now result in all the items in the
container being dropped, and not the container itself.  It could be argued
this should be a client issue (client send a move for each item in the
container).  However, dropping everything in the container should be faster
than individually dropping (ie, you turn the container upside down), and
client dropping them one by one would result in that many commands of the
player being used.

Change esrv_move_object to use the pick_up function instead of pick_up_object.
The difference here is that pick_up will look for matching containers, so
players manually picking stuff up in the client will have items go into
active containers as appropriate.  However, this can also cause problems
with smarter clients that really want the object to go into the players
inventory and not a container (I don't think any will have that problem
currently)

Fix in apply for holes - return 0 if we can not move the monster through
the hole - this prevents an infinite loop in move_hole in time.c

Added internal buffering for sockets if the OS's buffers fills up.  This
greatly improves reliability in the client.  Size of buffering is
setable in config.h

Fixed makefile dependancies - make install should now depend on the
actual programs it plans to install.

Fix some bugs in the animation code - most notable is animations with
just 2 facings like the quetcoutal.  Changes to archetypes is to
change the half orc to have 4 facings the quetzalcatl to have 2 facings.

Fixed animations to always use the direction value for determing object
animations.

Change examine code so that if the first thing in an object message field
is @match, don't display the message.

Fix map update code that wasn't calling update_los before sending the
map to the client.

Fix from Timo Kokkonen for socket code - check to see if we got an
interrupted system call (EINTR) on a read/write - if so, loop until it
clears or we get a real error.  Apparantly greatly improved reliability
of the server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.94.3 to 0.95.0:

Added diagnostic message if you try to use a skill and it can't find a match

Fix in send item command to better handle objects with a huge number of
items in its inventory.

Shop listing code simplified - send all data to the client at once instead of
havign to store it and wait for the player to hit a keypress.

Fix bug in ghosthit which would cause server to crash (patch for 0.94.3
was released for this bug)

Some general code cleanup - fixing/removing unreachable statements, removing
unused variable.

Build/configuration now done by autoconf (run ./configure).  This cleans up
a lot of special checks throughout the program, and hopefully should be
more portable.

Cleaned up/rearranaged the include/.h files.  Prior, most all structures
where included in structs.h.  Structures and support values now in unique
header files (ie, player structure and support enums and like in player.h,
object structure and support in object.h, etc.).  This doesn't change the
working on the code, but is just easier to maintain.  global.h takes care
of including these is the correct order.

Many options now removed from config.h file.  Options removed either relate
to X11 code/old server support or machine specific details which we can
now pick up via autoconf.

Better speed checking in update_object_speed.

When improving a weapon, client should now get updated (code was updating
the incorrect object)

Improve apply below to be more bug free (that is to say, we preserve
the pointer to the next object - I think there were cases where the
last of an object was applied, and thus removed, but the apply function
did not return a code specifying something was applied, so the code would
then try to apply an object with an invalid pointer)

Fix for collect.pl script to fix problem traversing directories.

(note for 0.95.0, there were many large scale changes, so many of the
entries below are more of just an overview of what changed, and not a highly
detailed account of the changes.)

Fix/improvement in player movers so that players trying to run in the
direction they move don't move incredibly fast.  They will still seem to
move faster (I am guessing roughly player speed + mover speed now).  I am
not sure of the original bug, but my guess is that the mover moves the
player to the next mover (which has a low speed).  But now the player still
has his own action left, and moves to the next mover which has high speed,
so wisks the player to the next mover, which has low speed, so he
effectively moves 3 spaces in one tick when he should just move one.

Changed save player method so that a directory is created for each
player.

Added per player unique maps (new apartments).  Maps from Christian
Stieber, however the implementation is a bit different - if an exit is
marked as unique, it will lead to a unique maps.  The unique maps are 
stored in the new player save file directories as above.

Removed all X11 support from the server code.  Change crossedit so that
it can read in the pixmaps as they are stored in for the client/server
support (so that only 1 copy needs to be kept).  This method of reading them
in is slower than the montage method unfortunately.

Changed socket handling.  Port 13326 has been removed from active service.
Socket information is now part of player structure, which cleans up a lot
of the old code which had to do with find the player that correlates to
a socket and vice versa.

Fix bug so that if invaliad variable is given to dm 'patch' command, program
no longer crashes.

Fix bug so that containers that have a huge number of items don't crash
the server (a container needed to have more than 250 items for this to
happen).  The real problem is containers that allow an infinite amount of
junk to be stored in them (Lepreds bag, but this item/map isn't part of the
standard distribution).  Even with the fix, there still becomes some point
where problems will occur (around 2000 items, the amount of data that
needs to be sent would exceed the size of the output buffer).  In any
case, with that many items in place, the player will see a noticable
performance hit when such containers are opened.

Fix bug that caused the program to crash when attacking ghost or other
creatures with ONE_HIT flag set.

Print out message to player if they have old keybindings.

Some map fixes by Christian Stieber - eliminate ability to bypass
quest and typo fixed in other map.

Fix so that perceive spell (off of rods/staves/scrolls) properly finds
the god of the player.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.94.2 to 0.94.3:

Fixes to some recipes - before some had non existant ingredients.
As part of this, a treasurelist for ogres added.

archsearch.pl function added to lib/adm.  Useful little perl script that
can do object context searches (ie, immune to X and attacktype of Y)

Old loader code removed - only lex loader supported now (no bugs reported,
so it seems to be OK)

Debugging output improved in various areas to be easier to read/better
inform what is happening.

Hopeful fix in place to prevent player movers causing players to have
-infinite in speed_left.  Fix right now is to just limit speed_left
to -50 - I believe the real problem is that some player moves have
speed=0.0, and it is diving by that value.

Fix so that if a player dimension doors onto a player mover, he no longer
gets stuck in an endless loop - he will now move along the movers as
expected.

When a player dies in NOT_PERMADEATH mode, clear the braced flag.

In the case of spell failure, don't cast mana storm in no magic areas
(instead, just kill the player)

Only write out an updated bookarchive if data has actually changed and needs
to be written out.

Don't print out new client server usage logging if nothing has changed.

Reduced power of 'loose mana' (it appears this only happens when a spell
is failed really badly).  It seemed to me that the area of affect and
damage could be many times deadlier than anything else out there.

Hopeful bug fix for thrown objects getting very fast speed (I am unable
to reliably reproduce this, so am not sure.)  Basically, I believe the
problem was that set_owner was only being set for the wrapper in the
thrown object, but it is the actual internal object that gets used at
some point in the attack sequence.  As such, I believe that the knife,
spear, whatever was getting the exp for the kill (exp = speed in 
weapons).  To hopefully fix this, I have also added a set_owner call
on the real object so when it goes to grant exp, it should find a
valid place for it and credit the player and not the weapon.

Changed spell parsing so 'of' is not needed in some complex
spells (ie, create food or marking rune).  From kfitzner@nexus.v-wave.com

Fixed bug in which you could kill multispace monsters with paralyze or
slow attacktypes.

Added ncom and comc commands to client and server.  These commands allow
client command queing/dropping (note that server will only send a comc if it
gets a ncom first, so old clients should still work just fine).  The
protocol numbers increased to 1021.

Added more objects to the show invisible list - hopefully the pupland
maps should now be fully playable.

RPLAY_SOUND definitions changed to RPLAY_SND - should make for cleaner
compilations for those using that.

Fixed #ifdef for NetBSD in common/time.c to use proper symbol.

Fix so that counterspell should no longer kill monsters with magic
attacktype (ie, jessys and probably others)

Added debugging in deathstrike code to hopefully be able to better track
down face of death problems.  My guess is that it is a problem with level
comparisons.

Fixed/clarified many nexted if/else statements that were ambiguous.  Now
braces are properly in place (From Klaus Elsbernd)

Hopeful bug for disappear objects when emptying bags.  I believe the
problem was that invisible objects ended up showing up in the containers
somehow - this by itself is not a problem.  However, the empty bag
function calls drop with the object to drop and keeps the next value - 
however, drop would forward past the invisible object so the calling functions
next value is no longer accurate.  Drop function now does not skip over
invisible objects in containers (will skip over them in player inventory) -
it instead removes the invisible object since I believe it is garbage
anyways.  I am not sure if this will fix the problem, but there was
certainly some problem in the code here.

Fixed bug with multipart monsters & pits.  Before, they got split into
a few parts like a magician trick.  Now they stay in one piece.  At
current time, the logic probably isn't great, as all that is currently checked
for is the head of monster being on a pit - in reality, probably all the
monster parts need to be on a pit.

-m9 and -mt options added (Code from Raphael Quinet).  Formulas have
been fixed such that all are now creatable (none missing archetypes).  However,
the output still shows some formulas out of balance in terms of costs.

Changed AT_GHOSTHIT meaning and added ONE_HIT flag.  GHOSTHIT is now treated
like any other attacktype (monster will not be removed just for having
ghosthit).  ONE_HIT flag now means the monster will disappear.  This fixes
the acid sphere deadliness (before, they did have ghosthit as an
attacktype).  All the objects with ghosthit have been updated.  However,
there are probably some other undead which could now have ghosthit added
to their attacktypes since it won't cause them to disappear now.

Updated the programming_guide doc.  Hopefully, it is a bit easier to read
and a little more accurate.

Improved polymorph.  Invisible objects should no longer appear.  Also improved
so that all objects of a type would be possible results (before, it would
be the first 80 weapons would be chosen from, or the first 80 monsters, etc.)
Now it is unlimited.  Smarter initial selection should also result in
a few less meltdowns from it now being able to find an acceptable object.
Also, possible fix that could cause crashes on rare occasion (monster
polymorphed into something else, and when inserted into the map, something
on that space kills it)  Also, we stop processing a space once we hit the
floor - I don't recall floor types ever changing anyways, but there could
be other problems processing subfloor items.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.94.1 to 0.94.2:

Changed calls to send_query on server side to include the string on what
the query is for.  This is to make clients be able to do smarter/nicer
things when it receives a query.

Bug fix in check_walk_on which would cause crashes when objects are put on
spaces with multiple destructive forces (ie, earthwall cast on top of
a double pool of chaos).  Once check_walk_on finds that the item has
been freed, it stops doing any further processing on it.

Animation code cleaned up.  Animations are now object properties, and not
archetype properties (and thus can be changed in maps).  Also cleaned up so
that the is_turning flag is removed - more complex animations available via
the num_facings.  Below is the section from the TODO file.  Note that there
is still potential to improve animations (many 1 frame animations could take
advantage of the new code to have multi frame (ie, players can now have
images for all directions, and animations for each of those) New code is in
common/anim.c:
  Clean up animation code and make it more general purpose (instead of
  is_animated and is_turning flags, instead add a value that
  states how many animations/direction there are.  For example, right
  now the big dragon has 8 animations and 2 facings (left & right), with
  4 animations/facing.  Something like num_facings could be added so we
  know there is 2 facings.  For arrows, num_facings would be 8, so we
  know that it shouldn't be animated (since there are only 8 images in its
  animation.)  This would make the code a little cleaner, and allow better/
  more complex animations (an object that faces 8 directions could have
  animations for all directions, were as right now, that is not possible.)

collect.pl changed to handle generation of animation file.

Wipe below added to crossedit by Steven Unruh

removed non NEW_HIT_PLAYER in attack.c (ie, old attack code removed)

Added hitback code (looks like it was missing from the NEW_HIT_PLAYER
code)

dm commands will now be accepted from the new client (provided they
have dm priveledges of course)

Add AT_INTERNAL attacktype used only for internal calculations (ie,
does that amount of damage).  Actual damage section of poison now
uses this.

Fix spoiler generation - don't convert monster archetype names to 
lowercase - images generated properly for them now.  Also, fixed problem 
with some images (dragon) being rotated when they shouldn't.

Clear INV_LOCKED flag when stealing objects.

Fixed couple of bugs in throw code.  First, players remaining speed
calculation seemed incorrect.  Second, you can now specify an object
name to throw (ie, throw ring, throw chair).  Third, the client now
gets properly updated with the new/changed item.

Make UNIQUE_ITEMS standard feature.  Removed LOCK_ITEMS as a secondary
feature - running multiple servers against the same set of files is no
longer supported.  Note for compatibility reasons of both methods, it will
look for unique files starting at v00 and will write new ones with the .v00
extensions.  If you have .v01 files, these will be read in the first time
through (provided you also don't have a .v00), but all new files will be
written with the .v00 extension.  Referances to ITEMS_DIR changed to
be UNIQUE_DIR - I think that is more descriptive.  This includes 
the environmental variable.

Change ok_to_put_more to do more complete checking and also not to stop
spells because of a monster with certain immunities being on a space.

If hit_player is called with the 'tail' of a monster, it would previously
just exit if the attacktype included slow or paralyze functions (must
hit the head with those.)  Changed hit_player so we just remove
the slow and paralyze, and still hit with any remaining attacktypes.

change explode_object so it only hits the monster once with the bullet/
meteor.  Previously, it called hit_map, which then hit the player, and
then called hit_player again.  This effectively doubled the amount of damage
caused by the bullet - it now does the correct amount of damage.  As
best as I can tell, meteor/meteor swarm does properly damage the monster
even if the tail was hit.

Bug fix in singing so exp should now be granted the first time singing
is used on a monster.

Changed so that server can be compiled with new client/server support but
without old (port 13326) support.  Various sections of code updated to
work/compile in such a setting.

Fixed premature freeing of map->tmpanme.  Now in delete_map instead.

Added checking in free_object to see if we are called on a non removed
object.  IF many cores is defined, will dump core here.  I believe there
is some section of code calling free_object on a monster without calling
remove_object, which is causing a lot of error/warning messages when it
happens (very infrequently.)  With this test in, it should become quite easy
to track down when it happens.

Added free bsd & net bsd to those systems whose gettimeofday takes 2
arguments (common/time.c)  -lcompat added to libraries needed for
FreeBsd.  Include unistd.h on freebsd.  Don't include malloc.h in
xbmtobdf.c on freebsd.

Sample ban_file added to lib.  Read in of ban_file will now
ignore lines that start with #.  Also, animations file (used for new
animation code) included.

Config file rearranged to hopefully be in better sections and easier
to edit. NEW_IMPROVE_WEAPON and SIMPLE_PARTY_SYSTEMS removed from options -
now always selected. NO_LOG, ONE_PLAYER_PR_UID, CHRFONT removed from
sections - these can never be valid.  NO_ADD added to prevent players
from adding others

Server updated to send full lines of text with query commands to client
so for clients that pop up a dialog box, they can print meaningful data
on what the request is for.

Bug fix so that you can no longer apply multiple objects of the same
type with apply -a

Give better messages when attempting to light something.

New client/server statistic gathering added - will periodically dump
usage stats to the log file.  Server will now longer crash if
client/supposed client sends bad data - will now just close the connection
instead.

Server will not longer crash when player runs into a door.

Can now longer polymorph objects into items that are invisible.

Removed client directory from main archive.  Too many people thought that
was the new client creating confusion, and I don't see a big need to have
it around (it will go away when the X11 code is yanked from the
server anyways0.  If you still like it, the old version of it will work just
fine (no changes have been made to it in a very long time0

Map changes:
  color_ removed from map files.
  library card cost decreased some.
  oldcity maps updated to take full advantage of XPM mode..
  Lake_Country/DA map changed - exp reduced, sp increased.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.94.0 to 0.94.1:

in artifacts file - moved some settings of difficulty before Object line.
(difficulty after the Object line have no effect)

In low level socket code, retry read/write again if we get a EWOULDBLOCK
in addition to EAGAIN errors.  Some systems return EAGAIN, others EWOULDBLOCK

Fixed possible crash in move_monsters.  I believe the problem was that
the monster got killed by a door, and the function was not expecting
it, and would use the invalid object.  Not sure if the code I put in will
really fix the problem, or just migrate it to a higher level calling
function (have not seen the crash myself)

If on linux, include crypt.h in main.c

Various minor memory leaks fixed.

Better error message for non wiz people trying to use shutdown command.
Shutdown command actually added to command structures and is now usuable.

Internal animations changed from explicit defines to use SET_ANIMATION
macro.  Much easier to read, and better supports client side animations.

Include sounds.h/sound calls no matter what RPLAY is set to.  Only
rplay special code is in sounds.h.  This way, client can still get sound
information without rplay being defined.

removed NPC_PROG code - not used at all - only thing there was a few
#ifdefs setting values.

Moved typedefs for function pointer stuff from structs.h to funcpoint.h.
No outside affect on code, just makes more sense internally.

Disable default selection of DEBUG_DMALLOC on crosssite.def

Removed old/unused charisma bonus values from common/living.c

Minor fix so that a space is properly added between item number and name.

Added a lex loading routine.  Performance seems to be roughly the same,
but ease of maintenace/readability seems better to me.  Modifications to
loader.c should not be done - instead, they should be done to loader.l
Loader directive flags and loader return flags added to loader.l - those
are now used instead of arbitrary integer values.

Fix c_wix.c dm goto command to set the destination object/map name.  Otherwise,
if an invalid map was entered, the enter_exit would try to print a null
string - some systems handle this OK, others will crash.

Changed common/time.c to use GETTIMEOFDAY macro defined once at top
of file instead of having #ifdefs throughout the file.

Fix so that items of differing values will not be merged.  Also, when
merging objects, do not clear startequip flag.

Fix in doc/playbook-html so all include directives are handled properly
with the include_html.pl script.

More details printed about improved weapons (how many improvements done,
max number of improvements.)  Also, skills will show how many improvements
the character can handle.

Bargaining skill will be auto applied when in shops.

Change teleporter code so the teleporter does not have to be the first
or second item on the space - teleporter can be any object on the space.

-a, -u apply options added (always apply/unapply instead of toggling).
Internally, apply and apply_special have been changed to take one more option
which is this flag.

Applied rings will not be merged - instead they will remain seperate.  Fixes
problems with getting full bonuses, and also makes it easier to apply/unapply
one item.

Increased frequency of generation for strange ring (nodrain ring).  This
should make it appear probably roughly as often as the ring of life,
or maybe even more often.

Put maximum carry limit in - beyond the limit, a character can carry no more.
This limit is fairly high right now, but should improve playbalance and
prevent characters from getting a negative weight or carrying so much
stuff it takes forever to move (session appears hung to them)

Added CS_STAT_WEIGHT_LIM to newclient.h, so client can know how much
the player can handle (only used for GUI, so it can do a carry/limit
type of thing)

Title information now used in hiscore displays.

Show invisible spell will now make handles visible.

New server code won't crash if player does nothing when it prompts for the
name.  Also, include necessary dummy functions so server will compile
of ERIC_SERVER is not set.

Will now search keyrings when running into special doors for matching
keys (players can protect keys by putting them in other containers.)

Change jump skill so that any spaces with FLY_ON set will affect
the jumping player.  This prevents the character from jumping over
player movers.

In create_wall - if insertion if the initial wall fails (new all is destroyed),
don't extend the wall.  Fixes the earthwall on top of pool of chaos which
creates strange map problems.

Map fixes:
     Lake_Country/ebony/masterlev altar should now accept fragment
	of chaos.
    Put no magic areas in apartment so it should no longer be able
	to dimension door and get keys.  
    /city/houses/wizz.entry should now be entered at the correct position.
    /city/misc/library - library cards are now identified, so it should
	no longer be able to buy then sell at a profit.
    /city/houses/wizz* maps:  removed ./ from start of some map paths -
	causes apparant problems.
    Lake_Country/Butakis/blacksmith - can no longer get free dragon mails
	or other items - have to pay for them now.
    Remove pup_land/rainbow/Lv4/\nkey (\n was an embedded newline).  Map
	doesn't look to be needed.

Archetype changes:

Added blocksview to gwall so you can no longer see through them.

Fixed up castle animation in bitmap mode (212/312 images needed to be swapped)

Increased exp for skulls from 3500 to 5000, reduced exp of deathtrees from
1400 to 1000.

fixed typo in gauntlets which meant title was set right.

aggressive 1 values changed to unagressive 0 values in some archetypes
(no such value as agressive)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.93.7 to 0.94.0:

Added outline of future versions in the TODO file.

a mana storm should now hit with godpower attacktype.

The spell create_food will now create food with 0 monetary value, and
be marked as starting equipment, so can not be dropped.

Player titles with spaces should now load properly.

Updated command times for use skill, ready skill, and stay commands so
when client executes them, proper amount of time is subtracted.

drop_object now preserves the freeze inv/look window, which prevents
slowdowns when picking up a lot of objects/dropped.

Added yield to water of diamond, fixed typo for dust of frost recipe.
If a recipe doesn't have a yield, recipe should still be properly
generated.

Hiscore savefile now stores maxgrace and seperates player title from 
player name.

Option added to only swap out maps when MAX_OBJECTS is exceeded 
(MAX_OBJECTS_LWM)

Changed internal definition from SOUND_EFFECTS to RPLAY_SOUND to properly
reflect what it actually enables (sounds for the client are always
enabled)

No longer put a 'a' for single objects.

Changed ring generation so rings of power can be generated.

Change can_merge so that more objects are mergable, add nrof 1 to some
objects.

Improved set_owner which can fix getting into endless loops.

Change insert_ob_in_map_simple so it doesn't call check_walk_on.  fixes
player being slowed way down when dropping objects on slow move space.

Animations moved out of archetype and into seperate array.  This is necessary
for the client as it makes a unique referance number for each animations.
Also, in future, this would make it easier to be able to change aminations
in objects/maps.

Print out level gain messages in red so they are more noticable.

Change can_pick so that invisible objects can not be picked up.

Change singing so you can calm a monster multiple times - you only get
exp once however.

Change show invisible so it only makes monsters and players visible, and not
things like magic mouths and ears.

Patch so that if peaceful is set, you will not attack other players even
if they have attacked you.

Auto apply woodsman/mountaineering benefit when in the appropriate terrain.

Fix get command so it takes from a container if appropriate.

shutdown and kick wizard commands added.

Client/Server changes for 0.94.0

Updated protocol version to 1010

Server debugging statements in ericserver can be enabled/disabled by 
define at top.

Client can lock/unlock items on the server.

Client can now look at spaces now.

Send update of item to client when it is identified.

Send update command to client from decrease_ob_nr to update players
overall weight.

Now send animation information to the client.

Now send sound information to the client, client can send setsound
to server to enable/disable sounds.

Client side image caching fully supported.

Added updates when picking up objects/dropping objects so that players
weight and container weight is updated if necessary.  Also, if object merges,
make sure we then send a delete of the original object that is now gone
to the client.

Update object changed to send floor animations to the client.

Send update when power crystal changes speed.

Send update of player object after player is loaded.

Change server so that only send map update and player stats once a tick -
should be more efficient and equally sufficient.

Added LOCKED flag to item transmission command so client can no which items
are locked.

Added item1 command which superceded item command - sends more informatin.

Added update command to protocol, and function in server - only sends 
portions of an object that need to be updated.

Server now properly handles repeat fire on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.93.6 to 0.93.7:

set_god wiz command added.

Changed call to 'index' to 'strchr' in commands.c - keeps with what
the rest of the program does.

Pupland archetypes and maps added (v1.2 of pupland distribution).

Changed get_random_mon to be more random when a monster of a specific level
is requested.

Casting transferrance spell on another playing and having their head explode
will no longet get the recipient of the spell exp - instead, the caster
of the spell will get the exp for any kills.

change put_a_monster function so it properly handles multi-square monsters
(put_a_monster is called by summon_evil_monsters, at probably others)

Changed alchemy so you no longer get exp for failed/random mixtures

If a container on the ground that the player is using (ie opened) is 
somehow removed, update the players view to now be the ground and not
the container.

Player titles will now be loaded properly from save files.

Can no longer sing and make the same monster unagressive multiple times.
The implementation is actually borrowing the NO_STEAL flag, which means
you can't steal after you sing, and after a failed steal, you can't sing
and calm it down.  Also, make sure that only the 'head' of a monster is
sung to.

Fixed up CSword_116 xpm file (too many chars on one line)

Added note/option in config.h for systems lacking O_NDELAY.

Fixed up some of the quests in Lake Country - can no longer just run and
get the dragonbane or buy the armor with a lot of scales.

New Client/Server changes:

    changed esrv_send_face to take the client_num instead of client_id
    (should be slightly more efficient).  This does not affect the protocol
    in any way - it just makes the handling on the serverside more efficient.

    Changed item command to calculate objects total weight before sending
    it to the client (total weight = weight+carrying).  This is needed because
    there are many times that the client does not know what is in the container
    and thus can not properly calculate the weight.

    Change server so it sends updates for the parent
    items that the object is being moved from/to (ie, when removing something
    from a sack, send an update for the sacks weight).  For the client
    to properly handle the player being re-updated, some special handling
    had to be added so the inventory list would be updated and so that
    we don't try and add another player object (client search routine for
    tags didn't look at the player)

    Fixed server so it now properly updates the original item from which a
    portion of it is being dropped.

    Fixed bug in server handling which kept the -1 return code from a
    blocked socket and decreased amount to send by that - reset to zero
    so amount to be sent remains the same.

    askface and mapredraw commands added to Protocol by Phil.

    Changed load player function so it calls fix_player before sending
    initial data to client.

    Removed some printf/debug statements from pickup code for newcs in
    player.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from Crossfire 0.93.5 to 0.93.6:

If we fail to save a map, all objects on that map should now be properly
deleted from memory.

Fix possible crash when score is being generated if player is on
swapped out map.

Default output buffer for new clients is now 64k.

Partial code in place for client side image caching.

Alchemy changes from Peter & Brian.  Main change is that multiple recipes
can be made at once.

Bad grammer in messages printed out when readable object is beyond players
comprehension.

ethreality recipe commented out in formulae file.

Some playbalance issues on maps fixed by Samuli Tursas.

Internal handling of shop menus changed - instead of a list of objects,
change it to an array of strings.

Minor changes in porting.c to hopefully make that file compile properly on
more systems.

doc/experience updated with some more notes from Brian.

CAN_MERGE changed from a macro in define.h to an inline function in
object.c (only file it is used.).  It makes it a bit clearer, and hopefully
a little safer.  There is an option at the top of config.h for handling
of the INLINE function declaration.

Possible fix so that altars should not be re-concecrated if god is
set in the editor.

Undead monsters can now see in the dark.

Fixed bug in parse_command which would cause crashes if a socket connection
entered a string with a ; in it.

Increased string size in new_draw_info which prevents crashes/stack
corruption when really ling strings from a socket is entered.

Changed spell level/costs between invisibility and improved invis such so that
the improved version is now a higher level and more sp.

Now possible to steal from a creature more than once as long as character
remains unseen.  Each steal attempt will become harder in any case.

Remove some special player checking in get_nearest_player - I think it
caused some crashes, and wasn't necessary (in fact, clever players could use
it to get it such that monsters would not target them.)

When characters stop levitating, call check_walk_on so they will fall
through pits or other applicable effects.

Fixed up some archetypes which could be picked up when that should be
set (trapdoor, bullet, meteor).  The last 2 cases can not be picked up,
but clever casting of alchemy could have nuetralized them.  collect.pl will
now print warning if an object has walk_on set but does not have no_pick set.

Added new map from Bjoern Helfesrieder to starting town (Yarin's House)

Fix in item matching code that could cause core dumps.

Fixed clearinfo command so that it still works even if player is using
scroll mode (only if player issues the clearinfo command - other uses
of clearinfo in function won't clear in scroll mode.)

Improved shop listings so they are sorted by type, then sorted by name.

Fixed bug in backspacing the to the front of the first line of an
extended command - it now works properly and puts you back in normal
command mode (this got broken in the addition of extended line input.)

Player should still be able to save if they were the wizard.  However,
wizard status will be stripped for save, but the fact they were a wizard
will not be stripped.

Imp made even wimpier by Peter M.

If you set of traps, open doors, push a player, or roll a boulder,
you now become visible.

Change it so that when something/someone reads a scroll, only inform
the other people on the map (perhaps this is still overkill?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.93.4 to 0.93.5:

Replaced handbook make_index script with perl version.  Much faster, and
also fixes problem with echo command doing different things on different
systems.

Minor change in crossedit such that if it is not compiled with XPM
support, it will give an error message if run with the -xpm option.

Changed code so that experience objects no longer change stats (reverses
'fix' made in 0.92.9)  Fixes problem of characters getting extra
stat points from the experience objcts.

Fix bug that could cause infinite recursion loop in spellpath_msg.  From
cameron@ripper.stl.dec.com (James Cameron)

Fix bug in complex keybindings in which all the commands in the keybinding
were executed that tick.  Thus, if you bound a key to north;north;north;north
and pressed that key, you would move 4 spaces north no matter what your speed
was.  It now works properly, and you move at proper speed (keybinding is
copied into buffer in player structure, and removed as we go along.)  Note:
This buffer could also be used to hold keypresses not yet processed, but
that hasn't been done yet.

Added ability to enter lines longer than the info window is wide.  This
allows for longer keybindings or say commands.  It isn't the most
sophisitcated thing (the extra lines show up with a 1> and 2>, etc for the
extra lines, and we just redraw the previous line if you backspace that
far.  After you complete the command, it does end up redrawing the entire
command, which can take a few lines, which gives some confirmation on what
you typed in.  This feature was added to both the standard server code
and the new client.

Change use of tempnam to tempnam_local which we supply.  Standard tempnam
will look at the TMPDIR environmental variable, and use that to override any
other value for the directory - this causes problems if different people
runn the program and using the temporary maps accross runs. tempnam_local
will not look at the TMPDIR variable, and will instead always use the value
we pass it.  This can be changed if we were not compiled in SECURE mode by
changing the CROSSFIRE_TMPDIR environmental variable.  Code was also changed
so the CROSSFIRE_TMPDIR variable will not be used if compiled in SECURE mode.

Fix so that you can no longer move really fast or fire really fast by using
the mouse buttons in the game window.  Using the mouse buttons in the game
window should now result in the same speed as using the keyboard.

Patches from Peter Mardahl:

    Dusts now cast as ability and not spells.  This mean that they will not
    have magic as part of the attacktype.

    Spells that are cast on oneself now ignore direction.  Thus, healing and
    protection potions can not be cast on something next to the player using
    the object.

    Detector object added.  Similar to inventory checkers, but only
    periodically samples what is in the space, and doesn't look at the
    inventory, only objects actually on the map.

    Creators can now cause objects they create to inherit names.  They can
    also periodically create items.

    Arch diffs: imps weakened, cold dragon spews forth cold, creator modified
    to have default speed 0.

    New FireTemple set of maps.  These have been onto the Volcano in the
    southeast area of the continent.  The maps that were there were moved to
    world_e2, under the crater.

    Gradual light/darkness code put in place.  I fixed a few of the bugs
    that were in peters orignal version, so it works flawlessly for both
    server and new client.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.93.3 to 0.93.4:

Inventory checkers can now act as doors.  If no_pass is set in an
inventory checker, player can not move onto that space unless they meet
the match requirements.

Signs that are usuable only a fixed number of times added.

Fix for pedestals & buttons so they are only activated once when a player
moves onto a space (previously, they were being activated twice.)

Fix for connected objects so that they will not be sacrificed on altars.
This fixes a case where you might want to put a check_inv and altar with
the same sacrifice on the same space.  Before, the inventory checker would
be sacrificed on the altar, causing the linked button list for 
inventory checker to be corrupt.

Many maps updated to look better in xpm mode or just better in general.

Change in crossedit so that if you set the randomitems variable for an object,
it only sets the value at the head of the object, and not all parts of the
object (it would be nice to allow non head parts to have this set, but I am
not sure how to get what part was clicked on in the editor, since it seems the
head is passed to the function.).

xpmtopix.pl script added.  Eventually, I hope this will replace the
C version.  For now, all it is good for is to verify that the XPM images
are using the proper colors.  Numerous XPM images were not using the proper
colors (a lot were using brown, which is not an official color - see
the xpm template for what is.)

Cleanup of proto directive to turn __signed into signed.  Also, change
#if __STDC__ to #ifdef __STDC__ in proto files.

Fix so it should now compile if SECURE is defined.

Ability to more easily added needed libraries in crosssite.def -
Extra_Libraries option added.

Assume Linux has a prototype for tempnam (at least my version does.)

Many objects added, and many XPM images updated/improved.

Change in new CS code - don't send the version string until after we fully
set up the structure.

Change so crossfire will compile if SAVE_HOMEDIR is set.

Reverse actions of -m8 and -m9 (Believe they were doing the wrong thing
relative to the scripts and what the docs say.)

Change in hiding code and detection by monsters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.93.2 to 0.93.3:

Added a fill below function in crossedit.  This make filling in backgrounds
for maps much easier.  Basically, it just puts whatever object you select as
the bottom object of the bounding box.  If the bottom object on the map
matches the object being inserted, the object is not inserted.  As a side
effect of some code in GetMapObjectZ, if it matches the top object, it won't
be inserted either.  This makes things much easier to update map backgrounds
for XPM mode.

Hiding made easier for players.

Stealing is made easier for players, but harder beyond the first item.

Many image colored and perspective corrected David Sundqvist.  Also, several
new objects added (specialized altars, some more indoor furniture/more
orientations, some sliding secret doors, and new wall types.)  Barn image
naming conventioned changed to follow what is considered proper.

A few maps added by David (two temples in starting village, along with
a mercenary recruitment building.)  Also, some maps fixed to look better
in XPM made.

Party kill option added by Rauli Ruohonen.  IT lets you see who has killed
what recently in your party.

Saving throw for objects cleaned up.  Previously, an objects immunities/
protections were not being used correctly to determine if it made its saving
throw (that is why icecubes could be destroyed by ice).  It is now set up
properly.

Gods will no longer improve weapons that have been enchanted by other gods
(Or I believe by yourself.)

Fix memory overrun (1 entry) when initializing values for the images.

Program will not recover properly when it attempts to load a temporary
map.  This means that load_temporary_map returns the map object to use,
since it might change.

When setting the owner of a monster, clear its ability to use skills

Fix in decrease_ob_nr so it should now work on 64 bit systems.

Mapguide updated with various suggestions made on the mailing list.

Linux systems assumed to have at least random available (change in the config.h
file.)

't' is now bound by default to 'ready_skill throw'

missing demon types (imp, big_demon, Greater_Demon) added to the list
of demon races.

xpmtopix will print a warning if it detects and XPM file using a tab character
in the color name - makes it easier to track possible image corruption.

Check for power of improved weapons now in its own function.  Also, we
now properly check weapon power when improving one (before, you could
improve it one level more than you could actually use.)

When a container is applied, make sure it is a player applying it before
checking for new client/server information - otherwise an invalid pointer
is dereference.

Complex keybindings added - thus, you can bind several commands seperated
with semicolons to one key.

Fix in encounter.c so if compiled with RANDOM_ENCOUNTERS, the new
settings structure is used for map location.

Added check fot out_of_map in various places that needed them - prevents
some more core dumps.

skill identifications will now look on objects on ground in addition to
those in the inventory.

perceive self should now tell you what god you worship.

map reset times on maps (temporary maps accross multiple runs) will not be
altered if there is no map reset time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.93.1 to 0.93.2:

New argument parsing routine - we now parse arguments in phases.  With this,
I have moved many of the global settings into a settings structure, and 
allowed highscores to be displayed by class/name.  The man page and -h
option have also been updated.  Also, all the files that could
previously be specified via environmental variables can now be specified
with command line options.

The temporary directory can now be specified via -tmpdir command line option or
CROSSFIRE_TMPDIR environmental variable.

If you cast word of recall and then save before it takes effect, it will
no longer corrupt the character (and will in fact take effect when you
restart).

Don't let players throw starting equipment.  At the same time, don't mark
throwable items as starting equipment - instead, just give it zero
value.

Fixed inscription - now properly writes scroll when passed no string instead
of crashing.

Artifact monsters now possible (monsters whose abilities are changed based
on the artifacts file.)  Top of the artifacts file has more information on 
this.  For now, I have only set up the orc, ogre, and goblin to get
special leaders.

Temp maps can be reused across multiple runs.  See config.h for more
notes.

Bug fix in inscription:  If you inscribed a scroll and already had
one like it in your inventory, the game would crash after they
merged.  Also, if you failed in inscribe a scroll, the game would
also crash (object it was using to calculate experience had never been
initialized).  For now, I just changed it to return -10*spell level
as the exp award.

Items will now be merged with other items even if one has been inventory
locked.  This way, if you have some torches that are locked and you pick up
some more, they will merge in instead of showing up seperately.

Bug fix for saving throw on objects hit by cold.  There could be cases
where an object being processed is no longer on the map and would cause
a crash.

Change find_first_free_space to return -1 if there are no free spaces.
Calling function should check this and then do the 'right thing'.  This
fixes problems with runes creating monsters on top of monsters (or
below the player).

Magic map cleanup.  Now have magicmap field in NewFace structure.  This
field holds the color to use for magic map in low 4 bits, and various
flags in high 4 (right now, only floor bit is used, since drawing may
differ on bw systems with that value.)  magicmap filed is now supported
in .arc and faces file.  collect.pl modified to automaticaly put
magicmap into the faces file, will also copy is_floor into faces file.
magicmap takes a color name.  This seperation allows magic map colors
to be set independant of foreground and background colors, and simplifies
the code a good deal.  Also, it makes new client magic map support easier.
Now all the archetypes need to be updated (I have already done the armour,
connect and construct directories.)

Magic map for client now implemented.  Definition of protocol added to
Protocol file.  Only limitation implementation has over direct server is
it only flashes the position of the player who cast the spell.  This
seems perfectly reasonable to me (use color or other attribute to know
where other players are.)

Old client (telnet front end) changed so that it no longer requires
libcross.a.

save object should do a better job if it gets an object without an
archetype.

buffer size for LOG increased - there were cases where this buffer
was not large enough and was causing crashes (sending large amounts of
garbage data to the socket was one way.)

Load map will now reload the original map if the temporary map is for some
reason no longer around.

Fix bug where randomitems may not have been properly initialized for now
objects (was inside an #ifdef for CASTING_TIME)

strerror_local added to porting.c.  Lets up give up more reasonable
error descriptions for certain errors.

If an object is cursed, set its vulnerable values to its protected and
immune fields, adn clear those fields.  Fixes 'problems' with finding
cursed rings which are not really cursed (pro fire/vuln cold rings.)

If trying to switch to private colormap in XPM mode, check to see if 
we are successful.

Fix crossedit so that if you have a map loaded and you then try to load
an invalid file, it no longer crashes (now reverts back to old file)

Archetype changes: Golden unicorn horn now has its own set of images.
Editable field updated for the gods archetypes (they were showing up in all
the menus.)  living_chaos object added (need for Brian Thomas's maps.)

Update the editor/picks map so that all archetypes are included in at least
one of the maps.  Modified the map_info script to print out unused
archetype.

New server:  Only increase buffer size of socket if it would increase
overall size.

fix in skill experience calculation to use magic field properly.

Alchemy spell changed.  If there is a cauldron in area of effect, only
do cauldron alchemy.  Otherwise, do item to gold nugget conversion.

Added a few more notes/thoughts to the mapguide/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.93.0 to 0.93.1:

change race initialization functions to to fix cases where race is specified
in race file but no race is specified in the arch it points to - before it
would not be added to the proper race list.

include handbook.ps in the standard distribution.

Client server rewritten to no longer use eutl package.  Other bugfixes for
client server: server now properly sends delete item command to client,
client now properly adds up a containers (and hence players) weight, pixmaps
are now supported.

Snowball spells added - these are the same idea as the fireball spells. (by
peterm)

Magic wall will consume several squares now.

spells array (in spellist.h) updated - was missing a spell (cure blindness).

splitter.pl (by peterm) added to arch/dev directory - takes a larger xpm
file and splits it into 24x24 chunks.

icestorm and small snowball added to possible list of starting spells.

Only set minimum speed of 0.01 for players.  This fixes the bug introduced
in 0.93.0 where multisquare monsters moved too slow.

Only print out a creature lost a spell if it is in fact a player.  Only
applies for casting time.

fix_me command added - basically just calls the fixme function.  Can be
useful if you that your characters weight is for some reason incorrect.

Fixed sprintf that was copying over static character data if you tried to
form a party that already matched a name.  Also, fixed a possible buffer
overrun situation.

More memory leaks fixed by Rupert Goldie - also fix to prevent orated monsters
from attack themselves.

New xpm images for woods and some buildings by David Sundqvist.  The new
buildings have a bit more texture and 3-d look, the new woods look a little
bit more in scale and mesh together better.  The old images are in the
xpm_pref directory if you prefer those.

More code added to free memory when server shuts down (useful for
trying to track down some memory leaks).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.9 to 0.93.0:

Minor map changes:  Some maps cleaned up to look better in XPM mode.
Removed no magic areas from around the demilichs in lord ramsdre mansion.

map_expand perl script added (located in lib/adm)

Cleaned up use of externs and declarations of many structures.  Depending
on the linker, these would not be merged into one value, and thus not be
initialized/set properly (fixes 'mark pushed you bug').  This was a problem
at least on SGI systems, probably others.

If on a sun and not using sun's acc, assuming Stupid Sun Headers, even
if on a Solaris system.

Changed change_abil so it returns true if a value actually changed (useful
for printint out information when apply objects like potions.)  A lot of
return checking of this function in apply.c is removed - that checking
now seems obsolete.

Set visibility to zero at first stage initialization.

Put a lower limit of 0.01 for player speed.  This still gives an action
every 12 seconds if you pick up way too much junk.

When praying at altars, have gods grant out spells only if it is a spell
they are attuned to.

Cleaned up some memory leaks, courtesy of Rupert G. Goldie.

Cleaned up the cast command code.  Also, if you do something like 'cast p', it
will now show all spells you know that start with p, instead of casting the
first one it finds.

Shift middle button in the inventory window should now mark an item.

Fix button handling for look and message window so that only if it is clicked
with the right 30 pixels do we consider it a scrollbar event (before, anything
more than 270 from the left was considered scrollbar - works fine for
default sizes, but if you resize, it would cause problems.

If on SGI systems, don't default to using rand - it should now pick up
lrand48 or random instead.

Change spell casting such that if you aren't high enough level, it more
obviously states it (previously it said you 'lack the skill', which can lead
to confusion.)

Fix so that the first recipe is now accessible when performing alchemies.

Added many thoughts/ideas to the TODO list.

Increase buffer size for examine command - some object could overflow the old
buffer.

remove no_magic from all monsters - immunity values should be used instead.
am not sure 

Made changes for strcasecmp detect - was checking as defined(sun), now is
defined(__sun__) - this is proper and what the rest of the code uses.

define MAXNAMLEN in crossedit/Posix.h - needed for ultrix systems.

Made it so that boots are not always considered magical (since there are
now many plain boots out there.)  Also, removed the always_magical function -
is_magical should now handle it all.

Allow items of type BOOK to be identified, since you can now find non
identified readable items.

Change loot_object so it doesn't remove experience objects - this way skills
don't get removed when a player dies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.8 to 0.92.9:

Make sure all skills are unapplied when changing the class.

When generating a spell listing (cast with no options), display the
level of the spell (or den if it is denied.)  Also, display mage spells
in one batch, priest spels in another group - I think this is more
relevant now since these are seperate exp objects and draw on different
power sources.  Still no pause key (doing those is a real pain) - that
is really a client issue or we should just add a scrollbar to the text
window.

Removed level 20 from artifact 'sword of Beserkgang' - was preventing
characters from using it.

Put cause many wounds spell in PATH_WOUNDING.  Book chance for holy word
increased.

Let experience objects change stats.

Many debugging messages added or updated to print out more useful/
detailed information.

Changed usage and set_protocol function names in client/client.c.  This
prevents name collision with libcross.

Web site locations added to the README file.

Load and save window positions even if split windows is not set.  This way,
window posititions are lost if you run the game in non split mode (and I
don't see any reason to discard these values.)  Also, -split can
be used in addition to -w to get split mode.

Changed check inventory objects to recursively search through containers,
and cleaned up the code.  Also, added notes on crossfire.doc on using it,
and made basic archetype to use.  When using inventory checkers in
crossedit, have the attributes by default come up with connected and
lockcode fields.

Made change to unique items:  If the object is a floor and has unique items
set, then all objects above and including the floor get saved as unique
objects.  Also, when merging maps and freeing old unique items, make sure we
remove them from the button links.  Made an apartment map which characters can
buy permanent apartments and also store equipment in.  When exiting the
program, save off all maps so the unique items get written out.

Xpm fixes:  Moved floor setting from map loader to update_object.  This
makes it so that crossedit will display the map properly in XPM mode as
you make updates.  Also, made default visiblity 0 - this makes the double
floor work properly.  There still seems to be some bug when pasting objects
in the editor with respect to updates.

Change made to goths taverns and tavern in lake country.  Change is so
that some of the wimpier informants don't have really good stuff to take.

Periodically write out the book archive during play, and not just when the
program exits.

Bug fix so 'drop x items' should no longer crash.  Also, 'drop 1 item'
should now only drop 1 item of 'item', and not all of 'item'.

Bug fix so 'unlock item' should now work OK.

When throwing objects, clear the APPLIED flag before the throw.

Prayer granting from praying at altars changed around - you will get more
unusual prayers, and a Wisdom of 25 is not a yes/no cutoff - value of
sucess depends on wisdom.

Archetype changes:  remove no_magic flag from demon lord - I don't think
this should be set in any monster - instead, immune should be set properly.
Added damned flag to gates that are no magic (probably not necessary,
but I think it makes sense.)  Added check_inv object.  Removed some
duplicate skill types (same skill, different arch names.)

Have get_pointed_target return the head of the monster if it is a multi
part monster.

Change smite and finger of death spell so they have no effect if creature
reflects spells.

Fix to prevent bug crashes with magic rune spell.

Fix in spring_trap to correctly target the victim.  Also,
fix in find_traps which prevented the gaining of experience.

If character has bonus grace, display it with percieve self.  Also, load
and store the last_grace value properly.

Changes from Brians hide/attack patch:  Adjustments for attacking based
on varying factors, monsters wake up & call for help if it, can't remain
hidden if you attack, changes for monster detection of hidden/dark/invisible
players, players no longer remain invisible if attacking, adjustment in
exp for stealing, stealing and hiding chances changed based on terrain
and other modifiers, when generating flesh items, set no_steal, give 
chinese dragons some treasure, giants a little more gold.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.7 to 0.92.8:

races file changed, a bit more flexible.

Additional dump flag (-m8) to dump god information.

If attacktype is holyword, creature must be in slaying field of holyword.

Better handling for items that remove/add protections,immunities,
vulnerabilities. Only print changes if there is an actual change.

holy power, blinding attacktypes added.

Add poison to list of items that might not be identified.

Two when windows are killed:  1) data is freed properly without causing
crash now.  2) If player has saved but window is still active, will
no longer make a save of the player.  This save would be a no-item save
that the character had been playing.

Bug fix to prevent crashes if clicking a button in the message window
and show_Buttons not enabled.  Also, moved button handling in message
window into its own function.

Bug fix for pet monsters that should prevent cores if cycling through many
maps very quickly.

appendix for god information added to handbook (both latex and html versions.)

gods2 patch applied from Brian Thomas.  The main thrust of the patch is
to make gods objects/archetype, and not array entries in the source code.  A
lot of code needed to be changed to support this difference.

God patches so that game doesn't crash if no gods are set.

Hopeful change for FreeBSD so it automatically pulls in the crypt
library.

Can no longer cast spells which are beyond your skill level.

More powerful spell failures added.

Can no longer read scrolls/other readable if blind.

Fix bug that if a weapon had slaying, it slayed all monsters, not just
the ones it was supposed to.

Don't add the bows attacktype in when figuring out the attacktype of this
player.  This pretty much always gave the character a physical attacktype
in addition to everything else.

Fix 'peaceful' when using buttons so it doesn't crash the game.

path_to_player changed to work better on diagonals.

Spell choosing by monsters a bit more intelligent.

No longer get experience for disarming/finding your own traps or those
of other players.

Add NO_STEAL flag, with obvious meaning.  If a monster notices you stealing
stuff, all his items are set to this, so nothing more can be stolen.  Flag
is automatically cleared when items are dropped.

Add run and fire messages to message (stat bar) window.

Make USE_BUTTONS playable setable item instead of compile time item.

Don't insert heavy (>5 kg) missile objects into player when they hit - have
them drop to the ground instead.

--
Made more general object matching routines.  item_matched_string sees if
an object matches a string (which can be comma seperated list of many
things.)  find_best_object_match finds the best match in the players
inventory.

item_matched_string gets used for for matching multiple items.  It is
used in drop, get, take, lock/unlock

find_best_object_match is used for apply, examine, mark, search-items.

Also changed code so that certain actions are in sync with what display
mode is set (mostly drop.)
--

If levitating, you can now remove items from containers in your inventory
(after all, they are levitation with you.)

Clear is_changing flag if object is being thrown.

Changes made to inscription code to work better.

Changes mode to experience awarding for player skills.

Fixes made to Peter Mardahl's dragonquest maps.

Big Wizard, Belzebub, and Demon lord xpm versions colored.

Minor bug fix to container in Thomas map.

Some new archetypes/images for peterm/dragonquest maps.

Make food creation spell more dynamic - food names/values no longer hard
coded in.

Additional demons added by Peter Mardahl

Bug fix to prevent crashes with improve armor/weapon scrolls.

Bug fix to prevent crossedit from crashing when exiting with edit windows
open.

Fix to prevent monsters from throwing certain good objects.

Make sure praying over an altar only gets cleric spells.

Increase saving throw array to correspond with max level.

Monster hp/sp regeneration method changed some - more accurately tunable
for low regeneration values.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.6 to 0.92.7:

Monsters now tend to be more agressive about firing spells.  Several
changes - now monsters will fire along diagonals.  For multisquare monsters,
we check to see if any part of the monster has a good shot at the player,
not just the head.  This changes tend to make it more likely that a monster
will cast a spell and hit other monsters (makes a pack of wyverns more
dangerous, as many will cast spells at you.)  I am not sure if this is a bad
thing - all it means is that you can't mix fire using creatures with
monsters that will be damaged by fire.

Let archetypes in the races file have spaces (for Arch Angel)

Throwing code added - players and monsters can now throw objects.  Some
new throwable archetypes added.  You need to add throwing_skill to any
old players - you can run the utils/add_throw.perl <playerfile> to do this

crossedit:  If a object have editable of 0, make it so it doesn't appear in
any of the menus.

Max yield added to recipes.

Better checks for insert_ob_in_ob to make sure we really have a player
before calling some of the update functions.

Weight limit for custom containers is now saved.

If we load an object and find it has no archetype, just drop the object.
This shouldn't happen, but can prevent core dumps for maps with missing
objects or players from a different version.

Add 5 static buffers to query_name - it is now safe to call it a few times
in a sprintf or the like without losing the old value.

Added 'statistics' command.  Shows useful information about the
character (none that can't be found in the docs.)  Also changed
'skills' to show how much exp you need in each category for the next
level.

change_abil changed so that it only prints out what values/attributes
have changed.  Ie, if you remove a ring that gives protection from
fire, but have other fire resistance, it won't say you are more vulnerable
to file (since you are not.)

Charisma bonus/mechanism changed (again.)  Values in living.c are more
easily/directly translated into what it means for buy/sell cost.  Curve
also balanced out some more.  Query_cost changed so the value
mechanism is a bit different (unfortunately, we need to multiply the value
of objects by 4 to keep them roughly the same price as before.)

Added 'mark' command.  You use this to mark objects that are used for
other objects (ie, torches with flint & steel, weapon with improvement
scroll, etc.)  This removes the necessity that the item you want to apply
be the first thing in your inventory (in fact, that is no longer supported.)
This should also make things easier for the client.

Bug fix that prevents crashes on spaces which have a teleporter and sacrifice
altar on the same space (/Lake_Country/DA).

Some minor changes to lighting code, some maps also updated to
use lighting code.

Added halfling and half orc character to the game (From Brian Thomas)

Changed valuation for FLESH items.  Before it was value*level of creature.
Now it is value*sqrt(level*2).   For low level, this keeps roughly the same
value, but for high levels, it keeps things more reasonable (drops the
value of zombie corpses to about half previous value)

Bug fix for monsters that have attacktype of ghosthit along with
others (main fix ghasts, for Lake County, REtower/tower3, but
this could happen for any monster.)

Fix for attacks doing no damage against monsters they should.

Bug fixes to readable code - should no longer core dump (At times) when
books are created, should also be more robust and fix some other bugs.  Also,
give more detailed messages on how many levels beyond your comprehension
a book is.

randomitems now stored in object, not archetype.  This means that treasure
types can be changed in the map - a new archetype doesn't need to be added.
However, the treasure to set must still be in the treasures file (or you
can use none so treasure is not generated.)

Removed color_fg and color_bg variables from game - these have long been
obsoleted, but code to handle them has never been completely removed.

Changed code so that best wc possible is +/-120 - should now prevent
overflows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.5 to 0.92.6:

If player deletes window and we can't save, delete player objects instead of 
dumping them on the map.

Make NEW_PROCESS_EVENTS standard - remove old proces code and ifdefs.

Remove temporary object from cast_spell - pass along both spellcasting
and owner objects.  Seems to fix some bugs and increase reliability (also
is a better way to deal with it.)

Change made so that converters are also knowledge about 'money' psuedotype.

change spellcasting altars so they also push the button.  Fixes altars
on some old maps.

Some minor tweaks made to the artifact file - mostly clarification of names
or setting values correctly.

spellcasting skill renamed to wizardry.

Fix made so that 'old' potions (strength, int, etc) use correct price.

If you examine food/flesh items, you now get detailed information (food
value, protections, etc.)

Code by brian thomas so that book titles will remain constant across
different program runs.

Bug fix for crashes caused by multisquare monsters stepping on
deadly objects.  Basically, fully insert the object, then start doing the
check_walkon's one at a time to see if the creature dies.

Brian Thomas' valley of the sisters quest added.  Additional archetypes
and treasures added to handle this.

'sort_inventory' option added (player setable.)  IF set, when items are
picked up, they will be inserted by type, then alphabetical.  Very handy
for scrolls and rings.

Some fixes made to the kundi maps.

Flesh/alchemy fixes by Brian Thomas.  Flesh type now inherit properties
from parent creature (weight, and possibly protections/vulnerabilities are
added).

Change made for alchemy - you can't toss a bunch of junk in a cauldron and
get a good item out unless you sucessfully use alchemy.

handbook added to the doc directory (tex/postscript.)  And html version is
also there, along with an html version to the spoiler.  Tex version of
spoiler also fixed so it is generated properly with new Latex.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.4 to 0.92.5:

Som bug fixes made dealing with cursed improvement potions.

Always let players learn spells if they are in their starting spellbook.

New attack methodology put in palce.  To put in simply, if there is
only 1 attacktype, things remain the same.  If there are multiple attacktypes,
we cycle through them one by one, and take the one that does the best
damage and use it.  Some attacktypes no longer do damage - they are effects
(ie, paralyzation, slow.)  In the case of of these, the effect will always
be applied if appropriate.  Code looks to behave pretty much the same,
but is easier to follow.  IF new code is buggy, or you don't want it, 
there is a define at the top of attack.c you can change.

If god blesses you, lets actually remove the depletion object from the
player inventory.

Other god related fixes put in place - look to also deal with blessed
weapons.

Additional dump flag added.

fix bugs with USE_BUTTONS and the peaceful button.

Only allow write_rune to use objects of type RUNE

Bugfix in get_pointed_target if it can't find a target - prevents endless
loop

NRSPELLPATHS set to correct value.

Remove null terminator from gods array - not needed anymore.

Fix savethrow array size to match maxlevel properly (was 1 short)

remove damnation and remove curse now cleric spells.

Fix some header code to better work on solaris 2.5

Support for compilation with the dmalloc (debug malloc) package.

Allow altars and related items to match objects based on type.  Use hp
field of altar object as the type to match.

Library patch by Brian Thomas.

Various skill fixes by Brian Thomas.

Alchemy patch by Brian Thomas.  Here is a copy of his README:
+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 
        The amount of work I put into this was substantial; other than
        new code -- I created new archetypes, revised archetypes, altered the
        treasures file and created 2 new object types and a flag.

        It therefore may be enjoyable to install this patch (incl code)
        and *not* define ALCHEMY in define.h. In particular, this patch
        does the following things:
 
         1) more varieties of potions are available in shops.
 
         2) new gems and types of food.
 
         3) monsters will now leave behind body parts when you kill them.
 
         4) if ALCHEMY is defined players may make potions/artifacts.
 
        I have included instructions for installation in INSTALL.PATCH,
        and a brief document for using the code (Alchemy.doc). 
 
        Finally, as always, feedback is appreciated.
 
                                                b.t.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.3 to 0.92.4:

Various bug fixes to readable code.

Let altars be able to cast spells.  sp field determine what spell to cast.

Fix obscure bug that an arrow can be 'killed' if a monster that has hitback
moves onto it while it is moving.  Thus would then cause problems because
apply would try to remove the object after it had been killed.

Give quetzalcoatl melee attack skill.

Give experience for clawing attacks.

Include literacy skill with fighter skill - this should now give all starting
classes literacy skill.  I think it improves play balance.

Don't mark a players starting money as being start equipment - otherwise
they can't drop it on identify altars and it can get merged with money
gained at a later date, yet still be marked as starting equipment.

Bug fix in keybindings so that we check return of XKeysymToString to make
sure we don't use a null value.  Some keyboards have keys with no names,
and on some systems, passing a null pointer as a string causes it to crash.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.2 to 0.92.3:

Removed ability to use unpaid objects for sacrifices.

Changed weapon improvement code to be based on skill levels (if skills
are used.)

Code in place to generate hit points by average of fighter and overall
level - to enable this, change the #if 0 to #if 1 at around line 1040
in common/living.c

Books hack by Brian Thomas.  This mainly means that when emptry books are
created (or are otherwise on the map), that they will be filled with some type
of information.  Some (like monster/spells/gods/artifacts) are generated via
the program itself.  Information from a messages file that is stored in lib
can also be found.  Experience can be gained by reading this information.

Read/write patch by Brian Thomas.  This mainly encompasses the fact that
players can now write messages in books, that you must be literate enough (as
determined by literacy skill level) to read various books/scrolls.  Scrolls
are now not identified, but literacy can be used to identify them.  Players
can still read signs even if they are not literated (needed for game balance/
information)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.1 to 0.92.2:

Give artifact Gram weapon attacktype physical|confusion. Before, it was only
confusion which would never actually damage anything.

If a player dies in a shop, remove any unpaid items from his inventory and
put them back in the map.  Only applies in NOT_PERMADEATH mode.

Put in better DM security - now checks for name, password, and hostname (any
of those can be wildcarded out) - see the lib/dm_file for some demo.  To
supply a password for dm mode, just use dm with the password (ie, "'dm
<fireball>")

Lighting code added (with various support objects, spells, etc).  No maps
support this yet.

Don't baptize altars if we are in the editor.  Leave altars the way they
are so that they will be baptized the crossfire loads the map instead.

Allow the title of and object to be set from within crossedit.

Allow individual players to set the inventory icon, now longer a compile time
option.

If we get a non critical error and do an emergency save just in case,
then don't remove any information/objects.  This probably fixes the 
disappearing inventory bug.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.92.0 to 0.92.1:

Improved altar sacrifice code (actually, any object type that calls
check_altar) - treat a slaying field of 'money' as something special- don't
care what form the money is in (see docs for more details)

Improve identify table (in conjunction with altar code above) - now takes
any type of money, won't take money if nothing needs to be identified,
will identify as many things as money is dropped for (ie, drop 200 gold, it
will do 10 items)

In the map attributes in crossedit, you can select an option called
"ShowWeakWalls".  If this is selected, weak walls will be shown in a partial
teardown state - makes working with some maps much easier.

New client updated to support Power and Grace stats.

Magic system broken into 2 forms of magic - clerical and mage (they are
now seperate).  Power stat also added to the game - plays into mage
spellpoint (mana) total.  Grace also added - used for cleric spell casting.

Skill system greatly expanded - different experience types with skills
associated with them (only has meaning if you are using the skill code) - thus
you gain experience for certain categories as you use certain skills - see
doc/skills.doc for more info

Multiple gods added (via config option in config.h) - basically, different
gods have different enemies, and the effects cleric spells have will depend
on this.  Altars are created for different gods.  See doc/Multigod.doc for
more information.  Along with this, some new spells were added.

 Fix a problem of some objects falling out of sight when they shouldn't.

Send delete item to client if decrease_ob reduces the items nrof to 0.

Weight should now be fixed up when transferring stuff to/from containers.

config option called NO_AUTO_SKILL_SWITCH added - it means range type
doesn't automatically get switched to skill type when using melee weapon.
Main effects is that it makes it easier to switch between melee and range
weapons (pretty much makes it like it was prior to the skill code.)

Sack code cleaned up - we don't need to split an object to see if it will
actually fit in a container - we can just say how many we want to try to
put in.

Actually put wimpy command back in (all code was there, just the link to
call the fucntion was missing.)

Increase max count from 9999 to 99,999.  Wasn't that uncommen for high level
characters to have more than 10000 platinum coins.

When invoking spells, temporarily switch the range type to range_magic -
otherwise, a proper check for spellpoints is not done, and it then becomes
possible to go negative.

Modified crossloop so that it renames and compresses any core files created
while it is running - very handy for debugging (note that you could easily 
modify it to remove the core files instead.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.9 to 0.92.0:

Make sure the weight a container is carrying can never go below 0.

Fixed fall below code, so that objects with visibility will not fall below
objects that otherwise blocks view.

Fixed colormap problems with xpm graphics on black and white displays.

ALLOW_SKILLS is now the default in the config.h file.

IS_SUMMON_SPELL macro fixed (= was supposed to be ==)

Artifact foods added by Brian Thomas.  These are foods that can give some
nice benefits (stat improvements, etc), or be much nastier poisons.

Bug fix made to skill selection that would otherwise cause core dumps.

Bug fix made to query_cost that would cause core dumps if the alchemy spell
was used.

Fixed bug in dimension door that would cause core dumps if cast from a
wand.

find_target_for_friendly_spell fixed to use the get_owner call instead of
referring to op->owner (get_owner should always be used.)  Fixed core dumps
that were caused when the owner would be killed, but still have a pet
monster (vampires as an example.)  get_owner makes checks to make sure
the owner still exists.

Only set the windows colormap if on a color display.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.8 to 0.91.9:

Changed some parameter names from spell to spellnum.  Some compilers don't
like parameter names that match structure names.

Alot of skill code added by Brian Thomas.

Assume that Suns running solaris have strncasecmp.  Also, if using
Xpm_Pix, assume the strcasecmp is available (the Xpm library should
provide it.)

get_player_ob function now uses the CALLOC define, instead of just
calloc.

When dropping items onto objects that blocks view, they now fall below the
object that blocks the view.

XPM mode now works with private colormaps.  It will also switch to a private
colormap if it runs out of color during the xpm creation (works for
crossedit also).

Don't let players put starting equipment into containers.

A bows weapon class (WC) is now used to determined hit probability for
arrows.

When a player dies (in NOT_PERMADEATH mode), the character is immediately
saved.  Thus, if you die there is no advantage to crashing the server,
hoping for a copy of your character from before you died.

Set the value to 0 for arrows created with the create missile spell.

When transferrance is cast excessively, don't hit the person receiving the
spell with 9999 points of physical damage (otherwise, spell can be used to
kill many powerful monsters.)

Made some changes to make it compile properly under Solaris.

Fixed bug in dropall that would cause an infinite loop if the player had
an open container.

Exits can now inflict damage on players.

Fixed middle mouse button missle attack.  Now clears the fire_on flag.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.7 to 0.91.8:

Messages about an objects speed no longer printed to the console.

When players exit maps, no longer inform all the other players.

install-same and install-font directives added to lib/Imakefile - used
if game is being installed to same font it was unpacked in.

Client now supports receiving bitmaps - server does not support
sending them, however.

Max experience achievable is based on max level, not a hard coded
value (although, at present time, max level is hardcoded to 100)

insert_ob_in_ob now returns an object - needed for client/server code.

check_inv function added to button.c.  Trigger will be altered depending if
the character has a matching item (or lack of a matching item.)

Option added to config.h to make it so that backup saves will save the player
back at home, instead of the present map.  Code adapated from code sent
by John Steven Moerk (jsm@axon.ksc.nasa.gov)

Minor bug in crossedit fixed that would cause it to exit if both
-p and -xpm is specified.  Both can now be specified - it will effectively
ignore the -pix portion.

New skills added, with corresponding code to use these skills (from Brian
Thomas) Use of skill code is selectable in the config.h file.

Two new spells: summon fog and steambolt (from Brian Thomas)

Enchant armor code added (from Brian Thomas)

Fixed bug in crossedit that would cause it to core dump whenever a non exit
was selected and then the enter command run.

Fixed bug in attack.c that was using info_all if CASTING_TIME was
selected.

Made it so that decrease_ob_nr will never decrease the object number below
0.  This fixes a bug in that remove_ob would calculate a negative weight,
and then call sub_weight with that negative value.  This ended up resulting
in weight being added to the player instead of subtracted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.6 to 0.91.7:

Item saving throw changed around - items are only invulernable to attack
types that they are protectected or immune to.  For example, if an item is
protected from magic, and is is by AT_FIRE | AT_MAGIC, it still needs to save
against fire.  Before, since it was protected from magic and the attack type
includes magic, it would not have been affected in any way.

insert_ob_in_map_simple function added.  This is used in functions that what
to examine all the objects on a space, yet insert new objects as it goes
(polymorph).  This function will not merge objects, so traversing the stack
will work fine.  Should fix removing removed object bugs that used to happen
for polymorph (function should be used in other functions that do a similar
thing)

Damage field in objects is now 16 bits (signed).  Needed because some
high level spells would do more damage than could be stored in signed
8 bits.

The 'old' client program no longer compares versions - there is no reason
to, since the client doesn't do anything that requires an exact version
match.

Better handling of the Eutl library added - selection is now done
in crosssite.def.

Large lake faces expanded - now set up like walls, where auto join works.
walls pick file expanded to include this image series and some other walls
that were not previously set.

Pacify spell added - code from Brian Thomas

Show invisible and X-ray spell added (code by Peter Mardahl)

Face data is static - that is to say the the color for any face can not be
changed.  In order to do a face with a different color, a new face needs to
be created (or perhaps linked to the old).  This change was made because for
client/server communication, having a known color for each image greatly
simplify things (also, on monochrome or XPM displays, color information
didn't have any effect). Related changes:

	1) color information is no longer stored in the archetypes file,
	but continues to be stored in the individual .arc files.  collect.pl
	has been modified to store this information in a faces file.

	2) visibility variable added.  This is a face value, and it is meant
	to take the place of the DOUBLE_FLOOR_PATCH.  System will work like
	this if DOUBLE_FLOOR_PATCH is enabled:  the floor and the object
	with the highest visibility + the top object will be drawn.

	3) color can not be changed in maps - in fact, since color is now
	stored in a different file, the color handling for objects has been
	removed.  Note - when loading a map with crossedit, this information
	is silently ignored.  Thus, when then saving the map, the color
	information will be lost.  The maps should be updated with new faces
	if this color information is imporant.  The lib/adm/map_info perl
	program now will print out warning messages for maps that are using
	color changes.  Also, the code in loader.c can easily be changed to
	print out when it loads a color change (disabled because it is too
	verbose for most uses)

PLAYER_COLORS config option and code support removed - with new static face
information above, this can not be supported in any real way.

Shop buildings no longer have is_floor set.  This was a hack for the
DOUBLE_FLOOR_PATCH for XPM mode.  However, enabling it can make it so
objects disappear beneath the shops (due to the way maps save.)  Having
objects not disappear is much more important (IMHO) than having things look
just a little bit nicer for XPM mode.  Archetypes exist for it, but are in
the dev/unused/0.91/7/mood_floor directory, since no maps presently use them

Mood floors added (code by thomas@nomad.astro.psu.edu).  When activated,
these floors can change the mode/flags of monsters (make them aggressive,
make them unagressive, make them fall asleep, or charm them)

New output mode in place - this uses a much smarter buffering method - it
keeps track of several messages, and how often they are flushed is setable
with the output-sync and output-flush commands (a help file does exist).
All the various draw/write functions have been cleaned up, so that there now
exists only 1 front end function (new_draw_info), which takes flags,
priority, object, and the actual string.  The flags are defined in
newclient.h, as NDI_* (in this file because client should use the color
flags sometime in the future, and it makes sense to keep all the flags in
one place).  Priority corresponds to the listen level that the player has
set - the lower priority, the more likely it will be printed.

Certain runes/traps now work properly (things like create bomb and magic
draining would not work if the player is not on the same square as the rune)

When a player kills a window, the players objects will be destroyed
and not placed on the map.

Scrolls, rods, wands, and staves will always be at least level 1.

Beefed up demilich's.  Previously, for the experience they were worth,
it was much to easy to kill them.  Main difference is that now their
speed is 0.25 compared to 0.06

Fixed minor bugs with player movers - if the object to be moved had a
speed greater than 1, it was possible to avoid all affects of the mover.

Objects that slay are fixed up.  Previously, only if the race matched the
slaying type did it work.  Now, in addition, f the race of archetype name
matches the slaying, the object will slay.  This fixes stakes, and probably
a lot of other items that weren't slaying creatures properly.

Changed some of the stat bonuses/penalties for all the classes.  All the
'normal' races now have a net total of 0 (fireborn, wraith, and quetzalcoatl
are not considered normal races, so their totals are unchanged.)

Some of the items in the artifacts file have been fixed up - fixed
spelling errors and errors in placement of the difficulty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.5 to 0.91.6:

When player stops attacking, make sure his speed_left is not larger than his
normal speed.  Fixes a bug where you could attack a wall, then try to attack
in another direction, and move quite quickly for a short time, since weapon
speed would be used for that short burst of movement.

Drain attacks become attack type physical when the character reaches the
mininum experience possible.

Do not allow equipped weapons to be improved if they would make it too
powerful for the character to use.

errmsg buffer sized increased to HUGE_BUF.  Should fix some bugs that
were causes when this was overflowed in dump_object2.

SOUND_EFFECTS (if selected) is now defined when compiling all files.
Previously, it was only set when compiling files in the server directory -
this had the effect that the player structure was different between the
server and common area.

speed+2 items now increase speed properly.  Values in the computation were
not being cast to floats, so a speed+2 ended up giving the same amount of
speed as a speed+1 item.

Restoration changed around.  The spell will no longer restore depleted stats
- this can only be done with the potion.  The potion is now only generic
restoration - specific stat restoration potions removed.  Also, perceive
self will now tell the player what stats are drained and by how much.

Reduce the amount of experience you get from killing other players to
1/10'th what it used to be.  This should also discourage players from
killing other players.

SAVE_PLAYER removed from configurable options - it is always on.  I can't
see why anyone wouldn't want to be able to use this, and if you really
don't want to use it, removing the save directory would pretty much
work.

Fixed dropall command.  It wasn't dropping all items (seemed to
stop at first locked item.)  Also, 'dropall armour' now drops
helmets in addition to shields and armor.

Fixed heroism potion.  It was casting the incorrect spell (detect curse).
Now it casts heroism.

Fixed bug that would cause remove object to try and remove object.  When
loading maps, an object in a container in a container would not be inserted
(this mostly happened with an object in a chest in an icecube.)  Changed
code in load_objects to a recursive call, which can handle inventories any
number of layers deep.

Fixed bug in drop_all that would cause core dumps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.4 to 0.91.5

Inventory icons are now updated properly.  Also, the inv_name and look_name
arrays in the player structure have been redone - these are now arrays of
function pointers and use the shared string libraries to allocated and free
storage.  This should take less space than the fixed size arrays that were
previously used.

When buying equipment, weight is now subtracted properly from the player
for the coins that are used.

Maps can now have a fixed reset time.  This means that the map will reset
after a set amount of time, no matter whether it is accessed or not.  Useful
for highly used maps that really need to be reset once in a while.

Bug fixed in get_ob_diff.  The difference array would get overflow,
corrupting other data.  Many core dumps were probably caused by this.

Fixed bug in legal_range routine where legal_range would only check to
first item of type BOW in a players inventory.  This caused rotateshoottype
to not list the bow entry if it was not the first bow equipped.

Cloaks are not always turned into artifacts - normal cloaks can be found now.

Charisma bonus changed around some more.  Penalties are not quite as harsh
for very ugly characters - with the change, a character will never pay
more than 10 times to buy something than to sell that same item.

Various functions changed around and some new ones added so things will
work properly with the new client (still under developement.)  Most notable
changes were to common/xutil.c, with the newclient.c and newsocket.c
files added.

Unpaid items that are alchemied are now worth nothing.

TWO_BYTES_FONT is now a standard.  I can't see crossfire ever going back to
having less than 256 images.

free map->tmpname when it is no longer needed (before setting it to NULL).
this pointer is assigned from a tempnam calls, which (on Sunos 4.1.x) uses
malloc to allocate space.  Note - if this is not true for you system, let me
know, so I can put code in to handle this.

destruction spell (from scrolls) fixed.  This was actually a problem
in that cast_spell was not setting the owner properly.

Magic mapping improved for bw systems.  This actually makes it work like
it used to, with it doing stippling for object.

Casting of director spells changed.  Placement away from characters and
underneath characters now possible

New potion type added - Improvement:  This will raise level hit point or
spell point gain to the maximum value.  It starts at the lowest level (ie,
first hit/spell points gained), and will raise one value to maximum.

Some patches added (From Manfred Weichel, manfred.weichel@mch.sni.de) which
should make compiles on SVR4 work properly.

New artifacts (in lib/artifacts file) added.

Configurable option:  cone attacks no longer propogate through monster - it
will only hit the first row.  

Remove curse/damnation changed so that it will not remove curses which
are a higher level than the spell caster.

Polymorph code changed around.  Greater chance of items being destroyed,
value can never be greater than twice the original value, no mininum value.
Also, now the item value and not clone value is used, so things like
scrolls, wands, rods, etc should have the max price work correctly.  magic
is not maintained, rather, magic*4 is used as the difficulty for creating
the new item, with max_magic of the new item never being greater than the
magic of the old item.  The number of objects remaining after a polymorph
will be less than the original (10 arrows might become 8 bolts, for example.)

You will no longer attack players in the group you are in by running
into them.

Titles now restored properly from save files (only makes a different if
SET_TITLE is defined

When doing a save, check the return value of fclose when writing to tmp file
and the final file.  If either of these writes file, use the backup file
instead (previous save file is renamed as a backup file.)  Should prevent
problems when there are full filesystems of quotas in effect.  The character
will not be saved, but at least an older save file exsists instead of the
character being totally gone (like before.)  Patch from Laurent Wacrenier
<Wacren@Gin.ObsPM.Fr>

Plural names for items that have a 'of' in them is fixed/added.  This mostly
deal with potions (so instead of potion of dexterys, you get potions of
dexterity)  Patch from Laurent Wacrenier <Wacren@Gin.ObsPM.Fr>

query_cost changed around so that value for very low priced items are now
computed correctly.  Before, the nrof of items was multiplied in very late,
and various divisions (for being unidentified) were done previously.  For
low value items, this would result in a zero value.  Zero values still
result for low priced items if you only have 1 or 2 of them, but if you
have 80 of them, a proper value is now generated.

Code to control golems (and in fact many summoned creatures) now fixed.
Help file added about golems.  This also fixes a core dump that was caused
when a summoned creature was around, and another scroll was used.

Modified logger in common directory to no longer create a fatal error if you
get too many minor errors in and the editor is what is being used.  Before,
occasional errors would be reported by the editor (mostly dealing with not
found archetypes in maps), which would eventually cause a fatal error.  This
seemed erratic, because the editor never changes the tick, so loading one
map might result in the fatal error because of the error total from the
previous maps.  Also, when using the editor, having missiong archetypes
probably should not be a fatal condition.

food value can be changed in artifact file.  Food is mostly used to have
various meanings in different objects.  The artifact file has also been
updated about everything that is changable, and what the values mean (ie,
docs are built into the top of the file as comments)

Weapons/armor no longer 'disappear' when a class that can not use such an
item tries to equip a group of them.  That is, if a class that could not use
armor tried to equip 2 chain mails, one of the chain mails would disappear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.3 to 0.91.4

FLAG_NO_FIX_PLAYER is set before saving the player, and cleared after the
player is loaded.  Before, a character will full sp and hp could be save, and
when reload, not be at full strength.  This is because fix_player was being
called during the load process, before all the characters items had been
loaded and equipped.  This, the maxsp and maxhp values were that of the
character with no items.

Artifacts can now pass the various spell paths to the newly created
artifact.  The values are or'd with the previous spell path values of the
object.

The artifact file now supports objects with name NONE.  If this object is
rolled up when trying to generate an artifact, then no artifact is
generated. This allows for better tuning the chances of having certain
artifacts, by just reducing the chance of having an artifact at all.  The
'type' field of the Object in the artifact field is still required, but any
other fields for the artifact object are not used.

Crossedit fixed so that all the images do not appeared inversed when being
used on a monochrome display.

Changed common/xutil.h so that XPM mode will work on monochrome systems.  In
fact, XPM mode should now work on all systems, previously, the load process
tried to create a pixmap 8 bits deep.  If the X server did not support it,
errors would result.  So while playing in XPM mode on monochrome may be
pointless, this allows play on systems where it may have some use.

libproto.h and sproto.h only check that __STDC__ is defined.  Previously,
__STDC__ had to be nonzero, and not all compilers set this.  Also, in
global.h, if __STDC__ is not defined, return an error.  Many compilers do not
allow _STDC__ to be redefined.

Updated changable variable in crossedit.  Now the various spell paths can
be set in the editor.

SPEED_GAME now standard compile option, and not selectable.  Having it as
an option seemed to create more problems than bugs non speed game found.

Crossfire man page updated.  xledit.man changed to crossedit.man, to
reflect the name of the program it represents.

crossfire.doc updated with more information - mostly about new objects
added to the game.

More help files.

Objects with type CREATOR were added.  The objects, when applied, create
other objects.  Documentation in crossfire.doc.

Object that cast spells (rod, scrolls, wands, and horns) now have a level
associated with them.  This level is used to determine at what level the
spell should be cast, instead of using the owners level, which was typically
used before (allows creation of super powerful wands/rods/horns, but having
them be a very high level.)

Bow, crossbow, bolt, and arrow code redone by Tero Haatanen.  This cleans up
the code, and allows for magical arrows and bolts.

Race can now be changed in the artifacts file.

A spell of Banishment has been added.

Attacktype AT_DEATH is now more potent when if against a monster that
the item also has slayign capability against.

Bug fixed to prevent players from getting infinite experience for finding
the same trap.  Also, experience changed for disarming traps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.2 to 0.91.3

Changed artifact structure so that items with a chance greater than
255 are now possible.

Object now put into icecubes when hit by a cold spell, like before.  This
probably got messed up in the saving throw re-write, where objects had to be
either immune or protected from cold to be put in icecubes.  In fact, the
reverse was supposed (and now does) happen.  IF an object is
protected/immune from cold, it is also immune from being put in an icecbub.

Fixed up is_magical and need_identify routines to handle more items.  Rods,
scrolls, and spellbooks are always considered magical in nature.  Wands and
staves are magical if they still have charges.  Also, fixed up so that some
of the Artifact items are now detected as being magical.

If player lacks sufficient money to buy from shop, it now prints how much
short he is in standard english string, (ie, 2 platinum 3 gold,etc), instead
of gold.silver format (lacke 44.25 gold).

Inventory drawing changed.  Should be a little more efficient, and be more
efficient on drawing.  With auto pickup modes (that pick up more than one
item), inventory will be drawn after all applicable items have been picked
up, instead of after each one.

Item status is printed next to item image in players inventory if
SHOW_INV_ICON is selected in the config.h file.  It would be nice if better
imagines were designed for the status (right now, just words are printed
out.)

When connecting to the server, a one line welcome message is printed.
Crossclient was modified to ignore this line if it starts with 'Welcome', so
changing it may cause problems with crossclient.

Potion of restorations are now handled by means of different archetypes and
treasure lists, instead of having special code in the program to handle
them.

If a RUNE is found in an object inventory when free_object has been called,
remove the rune instead of dropping it to the ground.  This is so that traps
(runes) disappear when the object they are placed on is destroyed.

Doors are now trapped, and be detected & searched just like chest
traps.

Map difficulty can now be set in the map, and not be calculated at map load
time.  Crossedit has been modified so that 'Attributes' now contains a
difficulty field, and if set, this will be used when loading a map (it is
stored in the level field of the map).  If this value is 0 (default), then
the old formula for calculating the difficulty will be done.  The advantage
of this is that map creators can now set the difficulty of the map more to
their liking, and certainly do a better job than the program can do.

Pickup by value density fixed.  The number of items is now taken into
consideration (before it did not, so a lot of arrows would be picked up,
because the total value divided by the weight of 1 arrow was greater than
the pickup value.)

Bug fixed in query_cost.  Before, for F_TRUE value, unless the item was
worth more than 10,000 sp, F_SELL value would be calculated instead of the
true value.

Merge several small files in common.c into one file called porting.c.
porting.c contains common functions that are called by crossfire.  This
allows system dependent code by be in one file, instead of scattered
throughout the program.

-listen_port <num> command line option added.  num is the port to use for
connections, instead of the default (13326)

Instances when a variable name is the same as a structure name have been
fixed (by changing the variable name).  On some compilers, this is a
problem.  I can not be sure that all such cases have been fixed, as I have
not found a way for gcc to create warnings in this situation.

Random happenings when a spell fails due to encumbrance has been added.
This option is configurable in the config.h file.

Trap code added.  Chests and doors can now be trapped.  'search' and
'disarm' commands added.  old 'search' command was changed to 'search items'

Inventory locking added.  Makes it so that items can be locked in a players
inventory, and will not be dropped when a 'dropall' command is issued.
'inv-lock' and 'inv-unlock' commands were also added.

'gsay' command added for party mode.

Spellbooks can now have their slaying field set to the name of the spell
that the spellbook is of.

Debugging output disabled in crossedit.  It produced copious amounts of data
that has little relevance except for the developers.  It can easy be turned
back on by editing the crossedit/include/debug.h file.

Artifact gems (worth lots of money) and amulets added.

Invisible object now appear in crossedit.  Fixes a problem, but now makes
use of the global 'editor' variable, making it likely it won't be obsolete
any time soon.

Artifacts (in artifacts file) can now have nrof field that will be used to
generated the number of items instead of the treasure list.  If the nrof in
the artifact is 0, then the standard treasure list nrof is used instead.

Artifacts can now grant reflect missile and spell ability.  Also, by setting
stand_still, the objects will not be animated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.1 to 0.91.2

Some options now standard part of game (SHOP_LISTINGS, Line of Sight).  The
config.h (for this release) contains these options, but they are commented
out with the note they no longer do anything.

Changed value pickup to pick up things based on true value, and not sell
value.  True value is how much the item is worth without applying charisma
bonuses.  Before, if two different characters used the same pickup mode,
different stuff could be picked up because of charisma differences (or even
if a character gained charisma, the same pickup mode may not work as it did
before).  By using true value, pickup mode operates the same between all
characters,

Items of type TREASURE can now have their experience set, and this will be
used for the difficulty of the generated treasure instead of the map
difficulty (as was done with shops).  If experience is not set, then the map
difficulty will instead be used (or 14 in the case of shop floors).

Cure poison actually cures it, instead of reducing the duration.

Don't use fseek when loading in map files.  Some systems do not support
fseek on pipes (which are used for compressed files).  Instead, just
set the variable with the data we read, instead of seeking back and
re-reading it.

Transferrance spell changed so that supercharging will have bad effects
(first confuses the player, then a large fireball is created (with player
losing all spellpoints)

Poisoning made more vicious - it does more damage based on the level of the
creature that uses it (level/2 in fact).  This makes it so that very tough
creatures that poison someone will have the poison do serious damage.
Also, damage caused is no longer random.

 Chests can now contain multiple items.  Code changed to handle this
properly.  Treasure is also always dropped on the floor (Even if the chest
is in an objects inventory.)  hp field used in chests (and in fact all
treasures) to determine how many objects to create (thus, a chest with 3 hp
will have 3 objects created).

Crossedit now draws a rectangle around the selected area.  Reversing the
color of the images did not work in XPM mode.

Have client.c include "includes.h".  includes.h sets up all the name defines
properly (ie, __sgi__, __sun__)

SP_* functions changed (by Rupert Goldie) to take an object pointer instead
of a level value.  This makes adjustments for spell costs (via stuff like
spell paths) easier to make, because now only the SP_* functions need to be
changed. With the object structure, checking for known paths (or perhaps
other things in the future) can easily be done.

Bombs will now be dropped before exploding.

New attack type (God Power) added.  The cleric cause wound spells use this
attack type.

Charm monster spell added.

Party system re-written by Scott MacFiggen <smurf@soda.berkeley.edu>.
Characters will now only share experience if on the same map, and other
features were also added.

Modified check_item function (used in creating weapons with the improve
scrolls).  The objects being sacrificed do not need to be in one group (ie,
two groups of 4 potions of dex will now be counted as 8 potions).  This only
applies to potions, since some can be identified and others not identified.
Also, cursed or damned items will not count towards sacrifice count
(although, they will be consumed).

Changed way cancellation works on items.  Before, if cancellation hit a
player and the player failed the saving throws, the items got no saving
throw versus cancellation (only if their absolute magic value was less than
RANDOM()%6 did they survive).  Now each item gets a saving throw.  Note that
if a container makes a saving throw, then the items inside do not need to
make saving throws and are unaffected.

A separate function did_make_save_item was split off from
save_throw_object.  did_make_save_item justs checks to see if the item made
its saving throw based on the tables (and any protections or immunities
grants it an automatic save, as before) save_throw_item calls this function,
and in addition, does the appropriate actions (burns up items, turns them
into icecubes, calls cancellation, etc.)

Saving throw method changed.  Before, each item got 5 chances to make a save
for each item it is composed of.  Now, it gets one chance for material it is
composed of.  Then, based on the number of saves it made, and the number
materials it is composed of, an overall made save/failed save is
determined.  This change is to make it easier to figure out saving throw
values, and hopefully make adjustment easier.

Saving throw tables updated.  In general, each item is +5 compared to what
it was before.  This should hopefully make it so that items have about the
same success rate they did before.

Crossedit modified to preserve value of connected field when cut/copying and
pasting.  Before, an object that was copied/cut would also have its
connected field reset to 0.

More XPM images colored.  Filenames for the river directory have been
re-done, to actually make it a bit clearer of what does what.  The archetype
names were not renamed however, to keep compatibility.

World expanded.  Another row of maps was added to the southern edge.  The
world maps were also renamed to a world_xy format, where x is a letter
and y is a number.  This represents the x and y location of the map, making
it easier to figure out how maps related to each other.

Map spaces can prevent magic user spells, cleric spells, or both.  Before,
an anti magic square prevented all types of spell casting.

Have monsters regenerate spell points even if they don't cast a spell.
Monsters have a 1:3 chance of casting spells, irregardless of any other
factors.  Before, spellpoints would only be regenerated if it got past this
check.  Also, some monsters (dragons, chinese dragons) have had their max
spellpoint and regeneration rates increased to correspond with the higher
cost of casting their breath weapons.

Altars now will also match on the slaying field of the object being
sacrificed.  This is similar to how keys and special doors work.  With this
change, it is no longer required to make a unique item that then needs to be
sacrificed (ie, the dagger, the cup, and the crown for the old city
quests).  Instead, a cup, and crown can be used, with the slaying field set
appropriately (unfortunately, will not work for weapons, as it will think
that is the monster to do extra damage against.)  However, the altar code
always did match item name, so calling it something special like 'The
Dagger' and have the sacrifice look for that should also work.

Spell encumbrance code added.  More you are carrying the higher your
chance for failure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.91.0 to 0.91.1:

Fixed bug in the enchant weapon code.  It was not allocing enough
space for the string, and thus would corrupt the heap.

Minor fix to spells.c.  IT was using strdup instead of strdup_local,
which caused the compile to fail on some machines.

No longer gets errors when adding a player on a map that is not
loaded in a multi player game.  Before, process_events would see that
the player has no object, and could get enough errors to cause the game
to quit.  Now, it suppresses errors if it is only loading objects
for that map.

Default map difficult for treasure that is created in shops was changed from
9 to 5.  In this way, the likelihood is higher that good items will be found
in dungeons, not in the shops (there are very few items with difficulty
above 9)

Archetypes cleaned up.  All archetypes that were not being used in a map
were moved to dev/unused/0.91.1.  Note:  There are still a few archetypes
that are not used in any maps, but these are part of a collection (ie, one
section type of a wall).  This was done really because there is no reason to
have archetypes that are not being used to be in the official distribution.
It could be misleading for people looking through the arch directory (ie, 'I
thought I looked at all the maps, but never saw this monster').  Also, I
have no problem moving these archetypes back in, once some maps actually use
them.

'grass' and 'sea' are no longer animated.  There are a few reasons for
this:  1) The animations never really were that interesting, 2) being
animated put them on the speed list, and being that over all, they are the
second and third most used objects, this is a performance hit, and 3) With
pixmap and xpm images, re-draws are only done on squared the have changed
(really improves performance).  However, with them being animated, they
often changed, so that more re-draws were needed.  The old archetype and
image files are in dev/old (in arch distribution) if you actually want to
use the animated versions.

Put a limit of 70 on damage bonus for weapons.

Treasure lists expanded.  The old treasure lists (in treasure.c) have been
removed, and treasure lists added to the treasures file added to take their
place.  The treasure file has been expanded have list transitions, and
treasure lists in which 1 object on that list will be generated.  Archetypes
(shop, random, and chest) updated to use the randomitems field to determine
what treasure list to use to generate the items.  Advantages of the new
method:  Ability to better tune treasure probabilities, re-compiling not
necessary in order to update treasures.  the create_treasure function was
modified to add an extra argument - this is used to keep track of how many
times it has been called on this attempt to create a treasure.  In this way,
infinite loops (with list transitions) are avoided.  Generate treasure
replaced with a simpler function that calls create_treasure, and returns the
object.  create_treasure takes a treasurelist instead of a integer
treasurelist number, like it did before.  The crossfire.doc file has
been updated about the new treasures file capabilities.

Chests are now created with their treasure as their inventory (this mostly
happened because of the treasure changes above).  Advantage is that when a
chest burns up, its treasure may remain (or may be burned up).  Before, when
a chest was burned up, its treasure inside was not created.

Rolling multi-part objects should now work better (not perfect, however).

Carrying an open bag with a mode that picks everything up will no longer cause
an infinite loop.

Crossedit changed to draw selected areas as a black box.  Fixes some problems
with display in XPM mode.

Fixed bug that would cause game to crash when pets were summoned.  Problem
was an infinite recursive loop, that would then cause the system to run out
of stack space.  Solution is to decrease the speed_left of the object before
one of the function calls.  This makes it so that at some point, one of the
functions will not be called.

When a rune is cast, use the s->archname for the archetype name, and
not hard coded strings.  Cured a bug with rune of transference.  Also,
allowed several case statements to be merged.  Really, no archetype names
should be used in spells.c, when casting spells.  The archetype name should
be gotten from the spell structure.

If a button is being updated on a map that is being saved, just return
from the function.  Prevents errors 'object has speed but is free'

Fixed bug that caused objects that got a speed_left of exactly 0 to
be frozen.  This was because speed_left >0 to have the object be processed,
and <0 to have speed added.  Now, speed is added if speed_left <=0.

Some minor changes made to hopefully make it compile on AIX systems without
any modifications.

process_active_maps now called when a map is being loaded.  It should
hopefully work properly, since enter_exit was modified to not use any
static variables.  Also, process_events was modified to take a map as
an argument, and if non null, only update objects on that map.  That makes
process_map obsolete.  process_active_maps was also changed to still process
even if there is only one player.
Crossfire should let players still perform actions when a map is being
saved.  Problem is, handling a map that is in the process of it being
saved, and having a character enter it.  Crossfire needs to finish
saving that map, then re-load it and insert the character.  Large changes
to how player interact with loading & saving of maps would probably
be needed, and probably should be done.

You no longer lose luck if you kill yourself, and the player who kills another
player now loses the luck (before, the player killed would lose luck).

Now inventory display modes - unpaid, cursed, magical, nonmagical.  All pretty
self explanatory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.90.5 to 0.91.0:

Some new maps added to the standard distribution (Magara and some of
the esben maps).  Magara was added as a place to depart to by ship, the
esben maps were merged in as new buildings or towers on existing maps, not
as a new continent.

Keyboard buffering is now selectable via 'keyboard' command.  Before,
an attempt to remove keystrokes from the X Events queue was made, but could
not always remove all of them.  Now, it should remove all of them, or none
of them, depending on the keyboard buffer setting.  The value will be
saved with the player.

Pickup mode value now saved and restored from the characters save files.

Inventory and look window should only be re-drawn once when selling
an item.

Calls to draw_stats in common/living.c will only be made if the object
type is a player (should prevent some warning messages)

Fixed create earth wall spell so that it uses bdur as the base hit
points of the wall (instead of bdam).  This will prevent some core dumps,
because otherwise, the wall can have 0 hit points.

Program should not core dump when person quits that game and the map he
is on has been swapped out. (ie, person saves or quits the character,
but the map gets swapped out before they type 'q' to the play again
question)

Word activated teleporter code added (Peter Mardahl).

Who can become DM, based on their user id, can now be set in the dm_file
(assumed to be in lib.) (Tyler Van Gorder)

Tell should now work properly (Eric Mehlhaff)

Cloak code added (Peter Mardahl)

Objects can not grant invisibility, make_invisible variable added to
archetype files.

Added information to the crossfire.doc file (was missing several
attack types and materials).  Added better information on what some of
the flags do.  Noticed that will_apply 4 applied for both scrolls
and earthwalls, now only applies to earthwalls.  To have a monster
use scrolls, can_use_scroll should be used instead.

Code added to deny users or sites from connecting.  This is to prevent
users who intentionally crash the server to connect and start up a window,
which they then crash the server with.  Patches from Tyler Van Gorder.

Two floors will can now be drawn when using XPM mode and this options
has been selected in config.h  This allows for towers to sit on top of
grass to look proper.  From Gregor Schmid <schmid@fb3-s7.math.tu-berlin.de>

Patches that modified 'create food' spell.  Better food (ie, waybread)
will be created at higher levels, and the caster can also specify what
type of food to be created.  From Peter Mardahl.

Spell paths added by Rupert G. Goldie <rgg@aaii.oz.au>.  Simply put, 
each 'spell path' contains a certain category of spells.  Objects and
races can be attuned, repelled, or denied certain paths (objects would
apply the the person wearing them).  Attuned allows casting of spells in
that path at lower cost and greater efficiency, repelled paths are cast at
a higher cost and lower efficiency, and denied paths can not be cast at all.
Thus, a wand of small fireball that is attuned to Fire would cast more
powerful fireballs.  A character wearing a ring that is denied the path
of fire could not cast fire spells at all.  Right now, no items will
be created using these features, and no characters have any of these, but
these might be added in the future.  Look at the spell-paths file in the
doc directory for a little more information.

Pickup mode 6 (pick up magical items) will not pick up known cursed items.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Object structure and process_events changed.  Now, a separate list
us used to keep track of active objects (objects whose speed is nonzero).
All objects on the active list are still on the normal list, but
process_objects only needs to go through the active_list for objects
to process, saving a lot of time.  The cost is adding two
pointers (active_next and active_prev) to each objects.  But the speed
gains are well worth the minor memory cost.  the 'malloc command
was changed to display the number of objects on the active list -
note that there is zero memory usage for these, since these objects
are also on the normal object list.

Programming note:  Any time an objects speed is changed (doesn't
happen too often), a call to update_ob_speed(object *) must be
made, so that the object can be added or removed from the active
list, as appropriate.

In testing, I first ran crossfire, with process events using the
normal object list, and printing out error messages if it found
objects that had speed but were not in the active_list.  I cleared out
a couple warehouses in Navar without any errors.

Then, I switched to using the active_list, and printing out errors if
it found objects on that list with zero speed.  I cleared out the
mages tower in Navar city without any errors.

Selling items now works properly (it only failed to work if
AUTO_SAVE was not set previously, and the value of the item was
beyond a certain amount.)

Look window code changed so that it does not erase the unused area 
unless necessary.  Also, when a player moves, freeze_look is set.
This was changed because the functions that move_ob calls update the look
window, and the window was being updated 3 times each time the player moved.

When poisoning ends, it no longer core dumps.

Inventory window updated if reading an unidentified spell book and you
already know that spell.

Casting rune spells now works properly.

Spells now (once again) sorted upon loading of characters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.90.4 to 0.90.5:

Bug fixed with window titles getting their names changed. (Tero Haatanen)

Container code changed around.  Containers can be locked, they can be used
from the ground.  FLAG_CONTAINER removed, since there is already a type
container, and bonus removed from object structure (Tero Haatanen)

insert_ob_in_ob sorts objects, so items with more magic are before those
with no magic bonuses even for unidentified.  It also uses the absolute
value of the magic, so it should be a little more difficult to know if the
item is cursed or not.

Added unique-flag and UNIQUE_ITEMS define. All items which have unique flag
are saved to directory .../lib/unique-items. A filename is mapname + ".v" +
number, where number is normally 01, but if two or more server is running
same time it can be also greater.  This feature can be used to banks and
inns to save permanently items.  The code is one limitation: if map contains
unique item which can be carried away from map (e.g. an unique excalibur)
there must be at least one unique item on map which can't be carried away.
This is because unique items are loaded from original map only if unique
items file doesn't exit. If all unique items are carried away from map then
they are loaded back next time when someone enters that map.  This should
not a problem if map makers remembers this. (Tero Haatanen)

Editor by Jarkko Sonninen. He added toggle button into attribute window and
made map's reset time and timeout so that they can be configured in maps. He
also fixed map archetype, so that map default stating coordinate is (2,2)
like before.  This seems break a gatehouse map, where it use default value
on map (changed 0 to 2), but it's easy to fix.

Change check_walk_on (common/object.c) so it no longer calls the draw_func.
This eliminates a problem of seeing flashes of areas that should be blocked.
This is because the draw function it called would re-draw the game window
before the variable to re-calculate line of set was set.  As I see it, this
function call was not needed in any case, because this is called during the
players movement.  After the player moves, the draw function is called from
the process_events (now process_players1) function.  This should also
conserver a little cpu time, and bandwidth.

Coin code in shop.c changed.  Patch from Kjetil Torgrim Homme made it so
that coin value can be changed in archetypes and the shop code should still
work properly.  I made changes so that the number of coin types is set with
a #define, making adding new coin types easier.

AUTOSAVE, SAVE_INTERVAL, and NO_EMERGENCY_SAVE should now work properly.
See include/config.h for more information on these options.

Changed it so that updates to other maps will not be performed while
loading a map.  This caused a bug if two players entered exits
at the same time.  One or both of the players may end up in incorrect
locations, all exits in that location may be closed, etc.

Saving throw table expanded to handle all materials and attack
types (Peter Mardahl)

Fixes so that Turn Undead does not do physical damage (Peter Mardahl)

Patch to make it impossible to prepare multiple weapons at the
same time (Peter Mardahl)

Added 'sea1' archetype.  This is the same as the sea archetype, but allows
for walk on.  Its purpose is to use for backgrounds behind boats and similar
objects.  Because it will probably be needed in so many places, I decided to
make an archetype, instead of editing the variables inside crossedit for the
object.

Removed xbm_values array.  This was used to map a face number to that face
location in memory.  Since the bmaps file is created automatically without
any holes, this is not longer necessary.

Archetype for wonder spell now in place.  This will prevent core
dumps when  the spell is cast.

Pixmaps will now be freed upon exiting Crossfire.  They will also be freed
after emergency saves are performed.  This fixes the problem that some
X-Terminals would not free the memory used the the pixmaps otherwise, and
run out of memory.  This fix pertains to both -pix and -xpm mode.

Patch to hopefully double death problem/core dumps with NOT_PERMADEATH
mode.

Changed the size of the temporary string that is used when loading
messages.  For a few very long messages, 1024 bytes was not enought.

Patches put in Crossedit to allow for XPM mode.  From Petri Heinil.

Cleaned up the code for look window.  Now, everything agrees (ie,
when you click on something in the look window, it is actually
that object.)  Likewise, invisible objects are not displayed
anywhere.  This should also fix a bug of not being able to enter
some building by clicking the middle mouse button on them.

Added help file for pickup.  Explains the 8 basic pickup modes
plus the value-density pickup mode.

Detect magic will detect magic on all items in a stack, not just the
top object.

Spells fixes (From Peter Mardahl):
  1)  Identify modified to identify items on the ground if inventory is
        identified.
  2)  Detect magic spell finds magical runes and makes them more visible
  3)  AT_CHAOS and AT_COUNTERSPELL reimplemented so that they are not
        treated as special cases by the move_cone function
  4)  Magical walls created by spells (firewall, frostwall, ....) are
        fixed

If a map is reset, that map is then removed from the list of map objects
(what you see when you type 'maps ).  This way, the 'maps commands only
displays maps that are reasonably active.  This change should also save a
little memory.

make depend now descends into crossedit/Cnv to depend there.

Changed some of the colors in the xutil.c file.  This is so that it uses
the same colors as the official colors for XPM files.  It would have been
better to make those colors part of the official XPM colors to start
with, but it is a bit late to do that now.  The change of the xutil.c file
was made so that crossfire would not use quite as many entries in
the colormap.  The change in colors should be quite minor.

Two new pickup modes added - one picks up all money and gems, the other
all magical items.

Removed a lot of dead code from the various header files.  removed
hiscore.h from distribution (wasn't declaring anything that was not
being declared elsewhere.)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.90.3 to 0.90.4:

Many more XPM images now properly colored.  NOTE TO COLORERS: A few minor
changes have been to the xpm.template file (palegreen has been replaced with
green3, and a more medium orange has been added.)  I replaced palegreen
because it was very close to the 'green' color already present.  And a
medium green was lacking.  A medium orange was also lacking, so I added one
in.

New pickup modes, that can be based on value density (from
Peter Mardahl <peterm@soda.berkeley.edu>)

Spells now have a casting time. (From Matthew Zeher <matt@cs.odu.edu>)

Added libproto1.h file.  This will be used for function prototypes
are affected by certain settings (ie, SPEED_GAME).  This way, people
should not need to run 'make proto'

New XPM loading method.  Creates montage of the xpm files,
so that not as many calls to XPM are needed.  This has reduced loading
time to about 30% of what it was before.  Note: This done mean it takes
some more memory at start up, as the montage has to be stored 
temporarily.

Changed charisma bonuses.  At 30 charisma, it will no longer be possible to
buy an item, and then sell it for more than you bought it for.

Graphic exposures turned off on the GC's that are used in the game window.
Should improve performance.

When a raise stat spell ends, the proper message (ie, You look ugly, you
feel less intelligent, etc) will now be printed out.

If player NOT_PERMADEATH mode, and you die, a stat will only be decreased
one.  Before, that stat was decreased one, and the max stat was set to that
value.  So if the player was poisoned, or a stat was lowered due to some
other reason, that loss would become permanent.  Now, both the stat and
orig_stat only gets decreased by one.

invoke.c removed, cast_spell modified to handle what invoke.c did.

Keep old shoot type if reading a scroll, instead of it being set to none.

Raise stats spells should be progressively more costly (From Peter Mardahl)

Should now be able to handle broken pipes without problem (ie, telnet
session closing unexpectedly).  Made it so that listen level 0 on a socket
means that draw_all_sockets will not write to that socket.  Crossclient uses
this so that it does not get unexpected messages, and thinks that it failed.

Added 'set font' option.  This basically unsets color pixmaps or xpm mode.
If crossclient was run without -xpm or -pix mode, it will send this command
to use fonts.  What this means is that set (font,pix,xpm) should set that
display mode.  Before, the display selection it defaulted to for crossclient
seemed unreliable at best.

Fixed memory allocation problem in commands.c (it was writing to more
bytes than it had allocated)

Draw message window almost complete re-written.  In an effort to cut
down on flashing of the the status bars. ( Niilo Neuvo <anipa@guru.magic.fi>)

More bug fixes for spells (from Peter Mardahl)

Fixed some bugs for compiling on the Alpha running OSF/1 1.3

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.90.2 to 0.90.3:

Added -xpm command line option to crossclient.

All spells should not be handled in the switch statement in spells.c

Let players buy zero value items from shop.  This really shouldn't be a
problem, the only zero value items of any use might be wands with very
few charges.  If someone wants to buy poison or cursed items, they should
be able to.

Fix spelling error of command line argument 'detatch'.  It is now
spelled properly (detach).

Change draw_color_pix in server/xio.c.  It now draws the images to an
intermediate pixmap, and then draws that to the screen.  May or may not be
quicker (XSetClipOrigin only needs to be set once), but it does prevent
flicker.  Also add two more GC's to the player struct, to make these
operations faster.

Unless XPM_PIX is defined, draw_color_pix will note be compiled in the
code.

Fixes to make it compile on both Solaris and NeXT machines (hopefully)

Removed PLAYER_COLOR #ifdefs and lines they control out of login.c.  Those
were not needed any more.

Added 'mapinfo' command to valid input commands.

Only have crossfire display -m as a valid command if it was compiled
with DUMP_SWITCHES set.

Changed install procedure to only copy those files necessary to playing
into lib.  Also, don't install obsolete scripts into the bin directory
when installing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.90.1 to 0.90.2:

Cleaned up the display from 'maps.  Now things line up nicely.  It
doesn't print the name anymore, and truncates the path at 18 characters.
But this doesn't make a difference for most maps, and now you can actually
see what variables are set to what.

Experience requirements changed.  Initial values from Peter, but I changed
them to be more round numbers.

Change targets in server and crossclient from ComplexProgramTarget
to AllTarget, DependTarget, and NormalProgramTarget.  This is because
ComplexProgramTarget expects man pages in those directories, which do
not exist.

Moved data initialization out of treasure.h and into common/treasure.h.
In theory, no data initialization should be done in the .h files, it should
all be done in the .c files, with the .h files declaring the appropriate
externs.  Likewise, no .c files should have extern's for other data
functions, they should include the appropriate .h file to get those
externs declared.  This would fix the problem of having to go through
the various .c files whenever one of the data structures change, to update
all the externs made to it.  Since the compiler will check to make sure that
the extern in the .h file and the actual declaration in the .c file are
the same, it prevents errors of mismatched declarations (ie, having
something like char s[40][20], which at later point gets to
char *s[40], but some files still think it is supposed to be s[40][20].)

Changed doc/Imakefile so that make install.man will actually install
the man pages.

Characters that dies who were poisoned should have the poisoning
removed.

Changes from the Berkeley Folks:
What we've done that's in this server code that I know of:

--level dependency added to many spells.

--level dependency tunable on the fly by editing the spell_params
  in the 'lib' dir and using the dm command 'spellreset'  spellpoints
  and spell level are also changeable on the fly.

--many new spells added
--protection spells can now superimpose, as can gain stat spells.
  repeated applications of protective or stat spells yield diminishing
  returns.

--runes added--an implementation of magical traps.  any spell may
  go in a rune.  Read the documentation.

--new spell interface.  invoke <spell> invokes that spell immediately.  Some
spells can take parameters now.  invoke magic rune <spell>
will store <spell> in a magic rune.  invoke  <spell> will not set the
range spell.  cast and prepare are synonymous.

--Certain spells cannot be set as range spells now--less than 10 of these.
These are spells which no one would want to use more than once in a while,
like magic map.

--A hack to object.c in common dir which makes objects created by objects
with owners owned by the creating object's owner.  (This allows players
to get credit for a kill with the meteor swarm spell, which creates a
'swarm' object, which in turn creates the meteor objects.)
-- End of Berkeley additions.

New maps and archetypes added.

Crossedit can now load maps that are compressed.

Add Solaris 2.x compile support.

Now prints out what the scroll name was that turned to dust.

Minor artifact changes (ring of ice is blue, ring of fire is red)

Horn range weapon now works properly, via using the + and - keys.

New input method (From Jari Vanhala <jam@modeemi.cs.tut.fi>).  Looks like
it should now be possible to define keys to do most every command.  Made
a few minor changes to default key file to make the present set up
act like the previous one.

Fixed triggers and magic mouth.  These devices will now open gates
as would be expected.  The problem was that the opening routine
expects to see the op->value of these to be one, in order to open the
gate or whatever.  Changed routines to toggle value between 0 and 1.
Note: As I understand, trigger handles return to their original state, but
keep the same value.  That is, you pull the trigger handle, the handle returns
to its original position, but gate opens.  Pull handle again, handle returns
to same position, but gate now closes.  Or at least that is how I implemented
the devices.

Make some more changes to the is_magical routine.  Hopefully, it will now
detect all rings and amulets that are magical.  Also, it should not
detect monsters (or any living object) as magical.

Fixed bug with Color Pixmaps (XPM).  Would try to free the pl->pixmaps
area twice, causing core dump.  Looks like the same thing should have
happened when using bitmaps also.  In any case, only one free(pl->pixmaps)
is now performed.

Bug fixed with XPM code, in which 'floors' would appear to be
carried around with the player.  This is because the players pixmap did
not change, and hence, it did not update that square.  Now fixed.

Random encounter bug might now be fixed (patches from Frank)

New FLAG method used.  flags in the object structure is now an array,
and SET_FLAG, CLEAR_FLAG and QUERY_FLAG functions are now used.  This reduced
a lot of code in common/loader.c

 Fixed bug in common/object.c in expand_objects function.  Looks like
braces were missing from for statement, so the the prev and flag fields of
the new objects were not being set properly.

 Fixed bug that could cause core dump if trying to print map message when
no message existed. (From Tero Haatanen <Tero.Haatanen@lut.fi>)

 Starting character will have uncursed, undamned and identified items
at the start of the game. (From Tero Haatanen <Tero.Haatanen@lut.fi>)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from Crossfire 0.90.0 to 0.90.1:

 Crossedit 0.7 was merged in with the 0.90.0 source.  This once again creates
a common distribution.

 I tried to retain the best features of both programs.  This means that
the artifact code, and cursed/uncursed items (from CF 0.90.0) remain.
But I also used the filepaths for fonts, elimination of omaps for
internals use, and creation of partially processed bitmap file for
bitmap reading.

 The general patch method was to keep the cf 0.90.0, and create a diff
file for crossedit 0.7 from crossfire 0.89.3.  These patches were then
applied.  Many had to be implemented by hand.

 There are some exceptions.  The crossedit program is almost the exact
same thing as in the crossedit 0.7 distribution.  I made a few minor changes
to clean up compiling, but otherwise, no serious changes were made.

 The archetypes (lib/arch) structure was also taken from crossedit 0.7, as
well as most of the archetypes themselves.  I think the breakdown makes
things much easier to handle for changes or improvements.  NOTE: it is
likely that directory (lib/arch) will not be in the standard distribution,
but will instead be a separate file (to keep the size down).  The various
files (archetypes, bmaps, font, etc.) will be created for the distribution.
All new archetypes from cf 0.90.0 were merged into the structure, as well
as a few minor changes in the old archetypes I noticed.

 The maps are from the crossfire 0.90.0-a-maps distribution.  A few
simple programs (in lib/adm) were used convert them to use fontpaths
and to change some monster names that conflicted with character classes.
Note: Because in the old format, a 'food' field was used to determine the
map to link to, it is possible some of these fields were changed when
they were not supposed to be.  This is because some other archetypes
(altars for one) also use the food field.  If you notice any converted
by mistake, please let me know.

 A few minor memory leaks and other patches have also been applied.

 Other specific changes to this version:
'set' now gives better help message (like what can be set.)
XPM code added.
Fixed bug in 'who', which would cause a core dump if done when
	another playing was still creating their character.
	'who' also display the map path of the other players, and not
	the map name.  Map names seldom seem to be set.
The crossfire.cfb and crossfire.pix files (in lib) can be compressed.
Fixed bug that caused core dumps when pet monsters were summoned.
If restoring a saved game, and the map it was saved on does not exist,
	start them on the standard starting level.
Added option in config.h, that allows full ring and amulet descriptions
	to be printed in inventory and look window.
Hopefully fixed bug which caused game to dump core when player died,
	if NOT_PERMADEATH was set on.
Add flag HAS_MAGIC, and use that for the detect magic spell.  This way,
	artifacts that have no magic, will still be shown as magical.
	So will rings that change abilities, etc.  Doesn't work
	quite perfectly, but seems to work as well as the old method.
Fixed bug so that if it can not find a map, it just prints that
	that exit is closed, instead of panicing.
Have it re-draw the look window when you middle click on something (ie
	apply) in that window.  This fixes a bug with bags/sacks, of it
	not updating when an item is used directly from a sack.
