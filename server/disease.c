Explanations:
* means this # should be negative to cause adverse effect.
+ means that this effect is modulated in spells by ldur
^ means that this effect is modulated in spells by ldam

attacktype is the attacktype used by the disease to smite "dam" damage with.

wc/127 is the chance of someone in range catching it.

magic is the range at which infection may occur.  If negative, the range is
NOT level dependent.

Stats are stat modifications.  These should typically be negative.

maxhp is how long the disease will persist if the host dies and "drops" it,
      in "disease moves", i.e., moves of the disease.  If negative, permanent.
      

value is the counter for maxhp, it starts at maxhp and drops...

dam     if positive, it is straight damage.  if negative, a %-age.

maxgrace  how long in "disease moves" the disease lasts in the host, if negative,
          permanent until cured.

food    if negative, disease is permanent.  otherwise, decreases at <speed>,
        disease goes away at food=0, set to "maxgrace" on infection.

speed is the speed of the disease, how fast "disease moves" occur.

last_sp is the lethargy imposed on the player by the disease.  A lethargy
       of "1" reduces the players speed to 1% of its normal value.

maxsp how much mana is sapped per "disease move".  if negative, a %-age is
     taken.

ac  every "disease move" the severity of the symptoms are increased by
    ac/100.  (severity = 1 + (accumlated_progression)/100)

last_eat  increases food usage if negative.



For SYMPTOMS:

Stats            modify stats
hp               modify regen
value            progression counter (multiplier = value/100)
food             modify food use (from last_eat in DISEASE)
maxsp            suck mana ( as noted for DISEASE)
last_sp          Lethargy
msg              What to say
speed            speed of movement, from DISEASE
