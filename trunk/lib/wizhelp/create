syntax: create <number> <bonus>
<archtype> <variable1> <value1>
<variable2> <value2> ...
notes:
creating items is rather dangerous
and tends to crash the server
when creating some items.

The number and bonus attributes
may be left off, or the bonus
itself may be left off any time.
If a bonus is desired, number
must be specified as well.
Archtype must be specified in
all cases. Variable and values
may be left off at any time,
but specifiying a variable
requires a value also be specified.

Multipart values such as for an
item name must be quoted.

Example: create 5 +1 sword
name "Spiffy Sword" face
chicken.171

This would create 5 +1 longswords
named 'Spiffy Sword' that look
like chickens.  see also: patch,
dump
