WHAT IS CROSSFIRE?

  This is a multiplayer graphical arcade and adventure game made for
  the X-Windows environment.

  It has certain flavours from other games, especially Gauntlet (TM)
  and Nethack/Moria.

  Any number of players can move around in their own window, finding
  and using items and battle monsters.  They can choose to cooperate
  or compete in the same "world".

REQUIREMENTS

  You will need UNIX, X-windows and an ANSI C compiler to compile this game.

  o DEC with OSF1
  o VAX3100 with BSD 4.3
  o IBM RT with BSD4.3
  o HP9000-series (HP-UX) (very old versions of HP-UX might barf on stdarg.h)
  o MIPS with RISC/os
  o (UMIPS) 4.52 (?)
  o AT&T system 300 with NCR UNIX SVR4 MP-RAS

  It has been compiled with X11R3, X11R4, X11R5, X11R6 (the editor requires
  X11R5 or X11R6).

  To get directions on compilation, read the INSTALL file.

USAGE

  Crossfire runs on a client/server model.  You will also need the
  client to play.  You can either connect to a server someone else
  has set up, or run your own server and connect to that.  The
  client package has information for connecting to servers.

  To run your own server, you need to make the crossfire binaries and
  install them, and then run the crossfire program.  This now creates
  a server which you/other people can connect to.  If you plan to run
  a long term server, you should use one of the scripts provided that
  will re-run crossfire if it dies for some reason.

WEB SITES:

  The following web addresses have crossfire information that you may find
  useful (Known to work as of 1-3-97):

    german version:

REPORTING BUGS

  First, check the INSTALL file for common problems, and see if yours is
  mentioned.

  Crossfire is still in a developmental stage - it is hardly a finished
  program.  As such, it is assumed that the users have had experience using
  X11 and C programming.  If you are a novice user having problems, please
  don't report problems unless you are absolutely sure it is crossfire that
  is the problem.

  The mailing list is where present development work and bugs are typically
  discussed.  If you want to know what is happening with crossfire, join the
  list and please ask there.

  I will likely delete mail messages of the following sort:
  1) Bug reports of failed installation when the installation instructions
     were not followed.
  2) Bug reports that contain so little information that it tells me nothing
     more than the fact that there is a bug.
  3) Bugs in which the solution has already been answered in the INSTALL
     file.

  When reporting bugs, make sure you include the following:
  o What version of crossfire did you use?
  o What type of computer did you use?
  o What release of the operating system did it have?
  o What windowing system are you using (Ie, openwindows, X11R6, etc)
  o What compiler (and its version) did you use (ie, gcc, acc, etc)?
  o Which flags did you give it?
  o If the bug happens when compiling crossfire, send an EXACT copy of
    the compiler line, as well as the errors it puts out.  Sending bugs
    of the sort 'it failed with a line like ...' doesn't help any.
  o If the bug happened while running crossfire:
    - Include any output before to the bug.
    - Give a description of what you did before the bug occured.  The better
	detailed the description, the better chance I have of figuring
	out where the bug happened, or how I can recreate the bug.
  o If you managed to compile Crossfire, include the output of
    "crossfire -o".

  Lack of any of this information in a bug report can make that bug report
useless.  Also, if you have a bug, make sure you are using the latest
version.  If you report a bug that has since been fixed, you are not likely
to get any help.

  Note:  If you can not reproduce the bug, and lack the skills/knowledge
necessary to run a debugger to find out where it crashed, chances are there
is little I can do to help.

  Note2:  I only have a sun 3 (with sunos 4.1.1 and gcc) for developement.
As such, if you have problems compiling on some other type of systems 
due to header files or similar system dependant things, I am not likely
to help out that much.

  Note3:  If you have core dumps, or trouble compiling on whatever system,
and are able to give me a guest account or something similar to log onto
your system to poke around with the code or core dump, I will likely take
you up on your offer.  If you make such an offer, I will assume that you
have oberyed whatever usage rules/policies are applicable for your site.

  Mail the bug report to crossfire-devel@listserv.real-time.com
