WHAT IS CROSSFIRE?

  This is a multiplayer graphical arcade and adventure game made for
  the X-Windows environment.  It runs on a client/server model.
  The client runs with X11, GTK, or  SDL within a gtk window.  A
  windows client is available, and a java client is under development.

  It has certain flavours from other games, especially Gauntlet (TM)
  and Nethack/Moria.

  Any number of players can move around in their own window, finding
  and using items and battle monsters.  They can choose to cooperate
  or compete in the same "world".

REQUIREMENTS

  For UNIX, X-windows and an ANSI C compiler to compile this game.
  A window system is not needed if you don't want to compile the
  map editor.

  For Windows 9x, you need Visual C++ (or some other ANSI C
  compiler that can read ".dsw"-files).

COMPILING

  Crossfire has been known to compile on a wide variety of
  systems.  It should compile and most all ANSI C and Posix
  compliant systems.

  To get directions on compilation for UNIX/LINUX, read the INSTALL file.
  For Win9x, read INSTALL_WIN32.txt.

USAGE

  Crossfire runs on a client/server model.  You will also need the
  client to play.  You can either connect to a server someone else
  has set up, or run your own server and connect to that.  The
  client package has information for connecting to servers.

  To run your own server, you need to make the crossfire binaries and install
  them, and then run the crossfire program.  This now creates a server which
  you/other people can connect to.  The map files will need to get downloaded
  and installed for the server to run properly.  The maps should be
  unpacked in the $(TARGET)/share/crossfire directory - after unpacking,
  you should have a $(TARGET)/share/crossfire/maps directory.

  If you plan to run a long term server, you should use one of the scripts
  provided that will re-run crossfire if it dies for some reason.

REPORTING BUGS

  First, check the INSTALL file for common problems, and see if yours is
  mentioned.

  Bugs should be filed at the sourceforge web site:
        http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=13833

  When reporting bugs, make sure you include the following:
  o If you have a sourceforge login, make sure you are logged in.  In this
    way, if there are questions about the bug, you will be notified about
    the request for more information.
  o What version of crossfire did you use?
  o What type of computer did you use (CPU type)
  o What is the version of the OS?
  o What windowing system are you using (Ie, openwindows, X11R6, etc)
  o What compiler (and its version) did you use (ie, gcc, acc, etc)?
  o Which flags did you give it?
  o If the bug happens when compiling crossfire, send an EXACT copy of
    the compiler line, as well as the errors it puts out.  Sending bugs
    of the sort 'it failed with a line like ...' doesn't help any.
  o If the bug happened while running crossfire:
    - Include any output before to the bug.
    - Give a description of what you did before the bug occurred.  The better
	detailed the description, the better chance I have of figuring
	out where the bug happened, or how I can recreate the bug.
    - If possible, a stack trace from gdb (or other debugger) is very
      helpful.

The more information provided, the better chance of the bug being fixed in
a timely fashion.

Further debugging information can be found at

SUBMITTING PATCHES:  See the doc/programming_guide file.
   The patches should be submitted to the patch tracker on sourceforge:
        http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=13833

PUBLIC SERVERS:

The best way to find a server to play is to run the client.  It will contact
the metaserver and present a list to choose from.  You can also see
a list at http://crossfire.real-time.com/metaserver/
