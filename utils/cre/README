This is a basic resource viewer for Crossfire, written in C++/Qt.

Resources are only readonly, but may become writable at some point.

Requirements:

  Qt 4 is required.  The project does not build under Qt 3.
  The crossfire-server must be compiled before this project.

To build:

  qmake && make
    (Builds in debug mode; change .qmake.cache to suit other needs better.)

Notes:

  PNG files in the 'resources' folder were taken from Gridarta's
  'resource/system' directory and are supposed to be under a free license.
