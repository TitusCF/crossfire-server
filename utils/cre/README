This is a basic resource viewer/editor for Crossfire, written in C++/Qt.

The tool does various things:
- list all archetypes, artifacts, animations, faces, and things like that
- cross-references maps
- computes spell damage
- simulates combat between monsters and a basic player (dwarf with no equipment)
- and various other reports (in HTML format that may be copied)

Most resources are only readonly, and more may become writable at some point.

What you can edit currently:
- NPC dialogs
- quests

Requirements:

  Qt 4.62 and newer is required.  The project does not build under Qt 3.
  The crossfire-server must be compiled before this project.
  A `make install` of crossfire server is required for CRE to run.

To build:

  qmake && make
    (Builds in debug mode; change .qmake.cache to suit other needs better.)

Notes:

  PNG files in the 'resources' folder were taken from Gridarta's
  'resource/system' directory and are supposed to be under a free license.

  On some systems (Solaris), -lsocket -lnsl need to get added to the link list
  for cre.  Easiest way is to just edit the Makefile (after running qmake)
  and add them.
