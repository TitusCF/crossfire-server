This is a basic resource viewer for Crossfire, written in C++/Qt.

It requires Crossfire to be compiled before being built.

For now resources are only readonly, but may become writable at some point.

To build: qmake && make
(will build in debug mode, feel free to change .qmake.cache to suit your needs better)

PNG files in the 'resources' folder were taken from Gridarta's 'resource/system' directory and are supposed to be under a free licence.
