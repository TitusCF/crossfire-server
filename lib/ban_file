# BANFILE
# A file which contains users or sites which are banned from playing.
# wildcards can be used in the file.  Valid entries are put on seperate lines.
# example entries:
# "joeblow@*.*.abc.edu"   ban joeblow at the given site : note only works if
#                         user is using a client, as telnet does not report
#                         userid.
# "*@*.*.abc.edu"         ban the entire site...works both with telnet and
#                         client.
#
# Note - banning by user name should not be used - the client
# (including the newclient) can easily be changed to use any
# username.  Also, with the new client, numeric host id is
# used (ie, 192.15.4.6).  So to ban sites, you need to find out their
# numeric IP address - not hard, 'who reports this
