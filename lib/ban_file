# BANFILE
# A file which contains users or sites which are banned from playing.
# wildcards can be used in the file.  Valid entries are put on seperate lines.
# For a ban to result, both the user and ip must be true.
# Note: Crossfire does not do a ip -> dns name, so matches for the
# second part must be by ip.
# Note2: The user portion is currently igored - the ban check is
# done before the user logs in.
#
# Syntax is "user@ip.address".  Note that when actually putting
# in lines, the double quotes should be ignored.  user should
# always be "*" for any form of banning to work.
#
# the ip address portion is done as a substring and not wildcard
# match.  Some examples, and results:
#
# "mark@tavern.us" - won't work - mark won't match, nor would tavern.us
#  match - must be ip address.
# "*@10.1.31.1" - users from 10.1.31.1 will not be able to play.
# "*@10.1.31.*" - will not work - * is not a wildcard for host matches.
# "*@10.1.31." - will do above - every ip that has 10.1.31. will be banned.
# "*@10.1.31" - will ban above, but would also ban things like "129.10.1.31".
#   
# Ip address can be determined by looking at the logs, or with the who command.
