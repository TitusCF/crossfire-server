Provides the last command input made and allows you to cycle through numerous previously entered commands. 

So if you wanted to run the second to last command you just ran, just hit this bound key twice and then hit Enter.

You can also edit the command before you run it.

This is just like the up arrow under most command line interfaces (CLI).
