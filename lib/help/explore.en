Explore mode lets a player explore without fear of dying.

Player will simply get back all her hp if she should die, and not even teleport back to bed of reality.

Caveats to enter explore mode:
- the mode should be activated in the server configuration file
- there should be only one player on the server

WARNING: there is no returning from explore mode. A character entering this mode will never be able to exit it, even if applying a bed of reality. The only way is to manually turn off explore mode into the player file directly.
