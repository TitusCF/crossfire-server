lock will lock an item in your inventory (it has to be unlocked to be dropped). If the item is already locked, it will unlock it instead.

Usage:
	lock <item name>

<item name> can be either all or part of an item's name. If multiple items could meet the partial name's criteria, the first one encountered will be selected.
It should be noted that the first item encountered in inventory may not correspond to the first item listed in the inventory window.
