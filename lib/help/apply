Apply applies an object.

If no options are given, it applies
an object you are standing on.

If an object name is given, it
will apply/unapply that object (toggle)

Extra options to apply:
-a: Always applies the object
-u: Always unapplies the object.

 These two options disable the
toggling feature.
