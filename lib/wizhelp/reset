syntax: reset <mapname>
notes:
all other characters must be
off of the map at the time of
reset. This will NOT reset any
unique items, such as players
apartments, in the case of unique
items being on a map, it will
cause them to be saved before
the map is reset.

Using 'reset .' will reset the
map that the player is currently
on.
