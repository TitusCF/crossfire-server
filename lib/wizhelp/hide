hide:

This hides the DM from being seen by other players.
This is done by making the player perpetually invisible.
It also results in the player not showing up in the who
command, maps comamnd, or being reported as a player on
the metaserver.

Note that the DM can still do things that makes his presence
known, eg, shout, other DM actions, etc.
