# spell_failure_effects only has meaing if spell_encumbrance is true.
# What it does, is that when the player fails a spell, various effects
# will happen (player is paralyzed, confused, wonder spell is cast, etc.)
# I disabled it because I think it would make life much too hazardous
# for low level casters.  They either need to wear light armor (which
# means that they will get pounded on by monsters), or will get
# confused/paralyzed/other effects often.  High level casters would
# be mostly unaffected, since they would be casting spells that are
# below their level.
# Note-  it seems that you still get some failur effects even with this
# not defined - most notably when reading scrolls and fail to read
# them properly.

# needed to cast it (first direction key starts casting, the
# next actually puts the spell into effect.)  It could perhaps
# be changed so that the initial direction is where it goes, and it

#
# Basically, if real_wiz is set then the WIZ/WAS_WIZ flags for objects

# Note that the file used to store this information is stored in

# This should only be set on private single player servers - basically,
# it lets you wander around with no penalty if you die, but otherwise

# Set this to false if you don't want characters to loose a random stat when
# they die - instead, they just get depleted.
# Setting it to true keeps the old behaviour.  This can be
# changed at run time via -stat_loss_on_death or +stat_loss_on_death.

stat_loss_on_death false

# This makes repeated stat loss at lower levels more mercifull. Basically,
# the more stats you have lost, the less likely that
# you will lose more. Additionally, lower level characters are shown
# a lot more mercy (there are caps on how much of a stat you can lose too).
# On the nasty side, if you are higher level, you can lose mutiple stats
# _at_once_ and are shown less mercy when you die. But when you're higher
# level, it is much easier to buy back your stats with potions.
# Turn this on if you want death-based stat loss to be more merciful
# at low levels and more cruel at high levels.
# Only works when stats are depleted rather than lost. This option has
# no effect if you are using genuine stat loss.

balanced_stat_loss false

# This allows players to build up a small amount of 'permanent
# experience' which reduces the effect of large experience drains, such as
# death. This makes multiple frequent deaths less devastating, and also
# ensures that any character will make some gradual progress even if they
