# Message file for books  
#
# Message entries contained in this file will  
# appear randomly in readable objects like books, scrolls
# and such (op->type==BOOK).
#
# To add an entry: 
# ---------------
# Start all entries w/ MSG and end with ENDMSG. The body of 
# the text between these 2 words will be the message.
#
# When designing messages please keep in mind: 
# -------------------------------------------
#    1) Message length shouldn't exceed the maximum
# buffer size for books (you'll generate a warning message
# if you do this). Check the file include/read.h for the 
# current message size limit (BOOK_BUF).
#    2) Text has to fit into the player message window.
# Don't design lines at lengths of 40 or more, or it will
# wrap around to the next line. Long lines will appear 
# differently to the player than as presented in this file.

"In the mountains north-east of the great 
city we found it at last--the hidden 
fortress of Barad-Dur. What treasures 
could lie in it I do not know for our 
party never gained its way past the 
entryway. Skulls, pixies, and a horrible 
creature I hesitate to name decimated my 
friends and I."

In ancient times past the great fortress 
of Ang was raised on the western shore. 
Many inhabitants it has had, but the last
known was the most unusual. A titan of 
rare power is said to live in Ang now.
There he serves as guardian of an arti-
fact of unusual might.

Many have ventured into the northern 
country. Up beyond the mountains, alone
in the wastes lies a vast domain of 
mines that delve deep into the earth. 
Know that these tunnels and shafts are
quite perilous; for only once in recent
times have I heard of an expedition
returning from them.

...and then did the Alchemist agree to
make me my potion. First he called to 
his grimm servants who hauld forth a 
great iron cauldron. Into this black 
device did he deposit his ingredients
and, opening his spell book for refer-
ence, then did he cast his spell of 
alchemy therepon the cauldron. 

  Greatly did the tub shake and move!
I thought that the Alchemist had broke
his device, but he chuckled at my ig-
norance. Into the cauldron did he reach
an brought forth a filled bottle of 
golden amber fluid...

  Know that there are 4 principle 
philosophical ingredients. In order,
they are:

   - philosophical salt
   - philosophical sulphur
   - philosophical phosphorus
   - philosophical oil

  The great alchemist has often said that 
all living things are made of these
ingredients. Proper combination of
these with other base objects can
often create potions of power and
might.
