"In the mountains north-east of the great  city we found it at last--the hidden fortress of Barad-Dur.

What treasures could lie in it I do not know for our party never gained its way past the entryway.

Skulls, pixies, and a horrible creature I hesitate to name decimated my friends and I."

In ancient times past the great fortress of Ang was raised on the western shore. Many inhabitants it has had, but the last known was the most unusual.

A titan of rare power is said to live in Ang now. There he serves as guardian of an artifact of unusual might.

Many have ventured into the northern country. Up beyond the mountains, alone in the wastes lies a vast domain of mines that delve deep into the earth.

Know that these tunnels and shafts are quite perilous; for only once in recent times have I heard of an expedition returning from them.

...and then did the Alchemist agree to make me my potion.

First he called to his grimm servants who hauld forth a great iron cauldron. Into this black device did he deposit his ingredients and, opening his spell book for reference, then did he cast his spell of alchemy therepon the cauldron.

Greatly did the tub shake and move!

I thought that the Alchemist had broke his device, but he chuckled at my ignorance. Into the cauldron did he reach an brought forth a filled bottle of golden amber fluid...

  Know that there are 4 principle philosophical ingredients. In order, they are:

   - philosophical salt
   - philosophical sulphur
   - philosophical phosphorus
   - philosophical oil

  The great alchemist has often said that all living things are made of these ingredients. Proper combination of these with other base objects can often create potions of power and might.

11 Tromisian 5211EK: We made a strange encounter while we were travelling down the ancient road to Lake Country. Plunderers from Jangk were attacking a caravan near the Iron Doors.

We of course helped the merchants, and easily defeated the bandits, some fleeing. But merchants seemed... uneasy, once they recognized our Guard uniforms.

We soon understood why: their twelve heavily sealed wagons were filled with Goblins, Orcs, and other creatures with the gift of speaking. They refused to tell us anything, so we decided to defer to the Lord's Justice. I don't know what will happen to them.

From some testimonies we could gather, this traffic has been going on for years, for the benefit of the biggest domains of Lake Country.

Me and my men will try to learn more about this.

In 5122EK, Bottle Riots, only reprimed with difficulty, in Port Jospeh drove local authorities to totally forbid taverns and other drink-related places, with the sole exception of shops controlled by the Sea Princes themselves.

However, Josephians rapidly found a loophole in the decree, noticing it only applied to buildings on or above the ground level. They thus refurbished to taverns caves in individual houses; they are indicated by their green frontage.
