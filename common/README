If you link with this library, it's a _very_ good idea to call
init_library() as a part of your initializing.

(If not, a lot of function-pointers will point to god knows where...)

Documentation for the functions have been collected into
the file ../doc/crosslib.doc.
This was done using cextract, see "doc:" at the end of the Imakefile.
