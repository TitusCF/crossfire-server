WHAT IS CROSSEDIT?

  Crossedit is a map editor for crossfire. (refer crossfire README)

REQUIREMENTS

  You will need UNIX, X window system release 5 with Athena Widget Set
  and an ANSI C compiler to compile this program.

COMPILING

  The program has been tested on SunOS 4.1.2, HP9000-series (HP-UX 8.0).
  It has been compiled with X11R5.

  If your local c-compiler doesn't understand ANSI-C, then change
  the CC variable in the Imakefile to an ansi-compiler (for instance
  gcc -ansi).

  Next construct the makefile by typing "xmkmf" in the directory where you
  unpacked the sources. 

  if you edit the sources you should create dependencies in the
  Makefile with "make depend".

  "make" maybe now creates a version of crossedit. :)

INSTALLING

  Package has its own archetypes and some special maps. copy them to
  corresponding places.
  make directory LIBDIR/doc, and copy file "help" into it.

PROBLEMS

  editor does not use backgrounds in .om files, because they will
  (hopefully) get removed from the game in the future. 
  Editor supports  pathnames in saving and loading maps. To use level
  numbers just give the number as name. 
  For some unknown reason archetype with name "dwall_3_3" don't work.

MISCELLANEOUS

  mapconv is a program to convert old .om -files to objects. Program
  creates new map.oo and map.om files and moves old ones to map.old.om
  and map.old.oo. it uses archetype names equal to bmap names.
  You need first to change $BMAPS in mapconv to you crossfire bmaps
  file, which is found from crossfire source.
  btw. remember to set correct permissions to the new maps
	usage : mapconv mapname[s]

STATE

  This program is under development.
