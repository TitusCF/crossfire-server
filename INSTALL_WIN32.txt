How to Install a Crossfire Server on Windows:

o Before you can compile the Crossfire source, you
  must include a guile library for windows and a 
  pthread libray for windows. You will find the needed libraries
  in the download areas of CVS snapshots and/or releases.
  This package is normally called "cf_win32_libs.zip".  
  You have to copy the files in the package over this crossfire
  source.

o First, you need to get the latest Crossfire sourcecode.
  You need two packages from cvs: "crossfire" and "maps".
  A good site to get it is <http://www.futt.org/crossfire_html>.
  You could as well download it from Sourceforge
  directly: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/crossfire/>.
  The third way to get it is at the official CF homepage:  
  <http://crossfire.real-time.com/Website_Index/download.html>.

o Second step, you must compile the program. You'll need
  Visual C++ to do this (or some other ANSI C-compiler that can
  read *.dsw files).
  After unpacking the crossfire package, doubleclick on
  "crossfire32.dsw", then - in Visual C++ - press <F7> to compile.
  If you don't have an appropriate compiler you can try to get
  the binary (crossfire32.exe file) from *somewhere*.

o Now open the "crossfire" directory, and run "installwin32.bat".
  After that, unpack the crossfire-maps into the directory
  "crossfire/share".

o Last step: Run the program "crossfire32.exe" (in the directory
  "crossfire"). A dos-prompt should open now, showing lots of
  weird text: the server logs.
  You're done - the server is up and ready for connections. :-)


If you still have troubles, write to the Crossfire mailing list:
<crossfire-list@lists.real-time.com>. Doing so, please
provide as much information on your problem as possible!
Most important: Tell us exactly what version of crossfire
you've used. If it's an old version, update first and see if
that solves your problem.
