Knowledge management documentation
----------------------------------
Date: 2010-01-18, by N. Weeger

Note: this document doesn't concern the technical aspects of the knowledge,
for such information refer to the server/knowledge.c file.


Any player will automatically keep trace of various information found ingame.

To display the known information, the 'knowledge list' command should be used.
Next to each item is a number, which can be used to get details of the knowledge
through the 'knowledge show <number>' command.
Note that numbers will change when new knowledge is gained, or when joining the game.


Currently, such knowledge is permanent and inalterable - no forgetting, no 'corruption'.


Ideally, a client-side interface should present such information in a structured way.
