This document explains how to reset certain spell parameters,
such as damage and duration, and the level dependencies of the above.

You may either change the compiled-in defaults, defined in spellist.h,
or the file lib/spell_params, which is read upon server initialization or
read upon the dm executing 'spellreset'.


Fundamental definitions:
level --  spell level
sp    --  the spellpoints the spell costs
bdam  --  usually the damage the spell does
bdur  --  the duration or range of the spell
ldam  --  how many levels above the min. level to cast the spell to gain
	  1pt of damage
ldur  --  how many levels above the min. level to gain one point of duration
spl   --  How many levels it takes for the spellpoint cost of the spell to double

This is the format of the file:

<spell name>
<level> <sp> <bdam> <bdur> <ldam> <bdur> <spl>
<spell name>
<level> <sp> <bdam> <bdur> <ldam> <bdur> <spl>
...

Spells not in the parameter file use the compiled in defaults
in spellist.h

sp_level_strength_adjust = MAX(0, (caster's level - spell level) / ldur) )
sp_level_dam_adjust = MAX(0, (caster's level- spell level)/ ldam) )

Examples:  if ldam=3 for small fireball, a 4th level character's fireball's
will do 1pt more damage per turn than a 1st level character's fireball.



Special cases and exceptions

cone spells:  bdur = duration of cone
	      
fireballs:  bdur ==  radius of explosion.

lightnings:  bdur == length of bolt?

bomb:  bdur == radius of explosion.

destruction:  bdur = range of damage
	      damage = bdam + int(caster)

turn undead:  duration ==  bdur + wisdom bonus

fear:  duration == bdur + cha bonus

holy_word  duration==bdur + turn bonus

summoning spells:  ldur:  how many levels needed to give the monster an
			additional 10hp
		   ldam:  how many levels needed to give the monster's dam
			additional 2hp/attack
		  bdam:  base damage done by monster
		  bdur:  base hp of monster

build [whatever]:
	hp = bdam + 5*sp_level_dam_adjust
	duration = bdur + 5*sp_level_strength_adjust

create food :  bdam = base food value creatable with this spell
	       ldam = food value += 50*SP_level_dam_adjust
