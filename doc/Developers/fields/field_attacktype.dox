@ref page_type_88
		</td><td>            This attribute specifies the attacktypes that this floor uses to
            damage it's victims. Attacktypes are: physical, fire, cold.. etc. If
            you want a real tough hazard floor, add more than just one
            attacktype.</td>

		<td>
@ref page_type_213, @ref page_type_28
		</td><td>                This number is a bitmask, specifying the monster's attacktypes
                for melee damage. Attacktypes are: physical, magical, fire,
                cold.. etc. Strong monsters often have more than just physical
                attacktype.

                When a monster with multiple attacktypes hits an opponent, it
                will do as much damage as the "best" of it's attacktypes does.
                So, the more attacktypes, the more dangerous. Attacktypes
                "magic" and "chaos" are somehow exceptions.</td>

            (so they are forced to move along a chain). For players there is no
            way to escape this forced movement, except being pushed by a second
            player.</td>

            restoration' - restore the player's stats lost by death or draining
            (this has nothing in common with the restoration spell!)
            'improvement' - increase the player's maximum health/mana/grace by a
            very small amount.</td>

@ref page_type_13
		</td><td>            This number is a bitmask, specifying the projectile's attacktypes.
            Attacktypes are: physical, magical, fire, cold.. etc. This works
            identical to melee weapons. Note that shooting weapons cannot have
            attacktypes.</td>

		<td>
@ref page_type_154
		</td><td>            If there isn't any spell (and &lt;summon monster&gt; is unset), this
            attribute defines what attacktype to use for direct damage when the
            rune detonates.</td>

	<tr>

@ref page_type_155

            the trap detonates.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
@ref page_type_15
		</td><td>            This number is a bitmask, specifying the weapon's attacktypes.
            Attacktypes are: physical, magical, fire, cold.. etc. Most artifact
            weapons have no more than one or two attacktypes. Keep in mind that
            all weapons can be blessed by the player's deity, thus adding an
            additional attacktype.

            When a player hits a monster with a weapon that has more than one
            attacktype, then he will do as much damage as the "best" of his
            attacktypes does. So, the more attacktypes you've got, the better
            your chance to take advantage of a monster's vulnerabilities. (Btw:
            Same rule applies for monster vs. player.). Attacktypes "magic" and
            "chaos" are somehow exceptions.</td>
