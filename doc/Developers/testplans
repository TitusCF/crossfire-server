Unit tests and functional tests documentation.

Crossfire uses the 'check' C automated testing framework available at
http://check.sourceforge.net
The presence of this framework at compile time is not required but is STRONGLY
recommended for developpers. You should not commit changes to the CVS if they
are not unit tested. In fact you should even write your new test before writing
the change.

Organization
============

All automated tests are in subfolders of the test directory. Directory
structure is as follow:

test
 +-rsc   ** contains all runtime ressources unit tests might need (maps, etc)
 +-include  ** include files specific to unit tests
 +-toolkit  ** generic function and toolkit shared by several tests
 +-unit  ** contains all unit tests separated with same structure as tested code
 |  +-headers
 |  +-common
 |  +-socket
 |  +-random_maps
 |  +-server
 |  +-crossedit
 +-bugs  ** contains test of known bugs (fixed and opened)
 |  +-bugtrack   ** Each file has the number of associated sourceforge bug id
 |  |    +-bug_<id>.c
 |  +-unrelated  ** Bugs that for a reason or another were not referenced on sf
 +-functional  ** contains all functional tests with structure of tested code
 |  +-common
 |  +-socket
 |  +-random_maps
 |  +-server
 |  +-crossedit
 |  +-general  ** put here func test not in previous func categories
 +-plugins
    //structure still to be defined

All source file having tests in them should be named test_*.c

Unit Test
=========
Put in subfolders of test/unit, They test the various crossfire functions. You
must write exactly one test_xxx.c for each xxx.c in crossfire sourcecode. You
must test in this test_xxx each function available in xxx.c. If you add a
function to xxx.c, write a testcase in test_xxx.c
Do no put files other than the test_xyz.c where xyz.c is a crossfire
source file. If you need to write test that does not conform to this, this mean
they are not unit tests and should go to functional/*

when test/unit is complete, each function of crossfire will be tested at least
once.

Note: because crossfire makeis heavy use of macros, macros must be considered as
function and so must be unit tested too. Because macros are defined in .h file,
the unit test should have the form test_xxx for testing xxx.h. All unit tests
for .h files go to test/headers

Functional Test
===============
While unit tests are testing each function of the code, functionnal tests are
testing behaviour of the whole. They can test behaviour of server after a
specific series of actions and check the integration of various modules. So
they are not tied to specific .c file or specific function. However, most
testcases will be concerned by specific module, so try to put the in
corresponding test/function/<module> folder. If that's not possible, put them
in test/functional/general.

Bugs
====
When a bug is discovered, here is the procedure to follow:
  1) write a testcase reproducing it (either in test/bugtrack or in
     test/unrelated, depending upon the bug being reported on sf or not)
  2) if the bug was not reported on sourceforge, provide enough information in
     testcase comments to describe the bug, preferrably at the top of test
     file, after the GPL licence header.
  3) when you successfully wrote a failing testcase demonstrating the bug, start
     to fix it (by writing the test you probably got a good idea of what goes
     wrong and the automated test will test each fix attempt for you)
  4) provide short information in test source code on what was wrong. If a later
     change in crossfire revive the bug, it will help fix it quickly.
  5) Commit your fix along with test.
  6) If bug was reported on sourceforge, mark it closed or ask an admin to
     close it. Mention you wrote a testcase for the bug.

Test ressources
===============
Some test requires maps, archetype or other kind of ressources to run. Those
are all provided in rsc or a subdirectory of it. Try to name those files
explicitly. Do not name it things like test-map or alike. Prefer forms like
rsc/maps/walls_blocks_move or like rsc/arch/selection_of_magic_books
each file in src/* should be documented in rsc/index.txt so other coders can
reuse those resources. Each subdirectory of rsc should have its own index file.

Toolkits
========
For some testcases (especially the functionnal one), you may need to have a
specific crossfire configuration loaded, or to do specific map operation. It
won't be surprising some of those operation are generic enough to be shared
amongst all testcases. Such support function (aka toolkits) will be made
available in the toolkit directory.

Includes
========
Testcases will share some include files not present in crossfire core. Those
test specific headers will be put in includes

This file contains various test plans when making changes to the code.
These steps are intended to give people an idea of possible things to
try out when changing the code.

 Please add to this file as you find bugs and develope some testing
plan to verify the bugs.  This is useful for future developers.

Try to organize the tests into groups that exercise that specific
area, eg, don't mix something that tests spell functionality in the
same area that deals with map loading.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Map Loading/Saving and Exit code.

1) Enter map not loaded before.  Does it load correctly.  Leave an item there
for future reference.
2) Exit map and re-enter quickly.  Is it loaded correctly?  Is that item you
left there?
3) Exit map, and wait for it to swap out.  Then re-enter.  Is that item there.
4) Repeat steps 1-3 with a per player unique map.
5) Repeat steps 1-3 with a map that has the outdoor flag set
6) Kill server, and re-run tests.
