This file explains the 'ITEM_TRANSFORMER' (163) item type.

Last update: 2005-07-19.

An item transformer is simply applied, after having marked a 'victim' item.
If the victim is suitable, it will be transformed into something else.

To make an item transformable, you just have to fill the 'slaying' field.
The syntax is:
 slaying slayer:[yield ]new_item[;slayer:[yield ]new_item]*

with [] denoting optional part, and * any number of preceding [].

Example, for object apple:
 slaying knife:2 half_apple

This means that, when applying a knife (non existing item with type of 163),
one 'apple' will be transformed into 2 'half_apple'.

Pretty simple, hopefully.

Transformer uses food value to count how many times it can be used. 0 denotes
unlimited uses.

The 'slaying' field of the 'transformer' is a verb used to construct a message.

More complex imaginary example:
 Object water
 slaying bowl:full_bowl;paper:wet_paper

if paper and bowl are 'transformer' items.
