This guide explains how to manage quests for player.

A new command, 'quests', has been added to let players see quests they are doing or have done.
It is not possible (unless specially made map to remove item) to do a quest twice.
Quests can have multiple paths and/or solutions.

Quests are managed through items in player inventory, inserted when needed.

<being rewritten>

Basics:
* name_pl = internal quest name
* custom_name = internal task name
* add a "quest_override" to npc/magic ear, set its slaying and name_pl/custom_name
  and fill in message with match. hp determines condition (quest not started, ..., see
  quest.c for details)
* in that quest_override add quest_[start|end]_[quest|task] with revelant fields set
* ending a quest/task removes the start marker
