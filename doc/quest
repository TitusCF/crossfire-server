Quest support information
-------------------------

Current quest support is low-level only.
That is the server provides routines to query and store quest status, and that's all.

It is the responsibility of the quest writer to call the functions, hook what needs to be handled, and such.

The server does no internal state check, and it doesn't know how to handle anything except the status.


Currently, a quest is composed of:
- an internal code, which should be unique
- a player title, a short sentence describing the quest
- a longer description of the quest
- the current player state (integer value, any positive value is ok, quest-specific meaning)
- the current state description for the player, so she knows what to do next

The information is stored in the player's directory, in a file named <player's name>.quest

File is saved at each state modification, to ensure consistency.
