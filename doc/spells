	Effects of spells imbedded into potions -b.t.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------

	  These are the "empirical" results of my testing the CF 0.92.4
	spell code. Seven main general effects, related to the way in
	which the spell manifests, are noted:

	      "360"  	Indicates that the spell is released as 
			in a 360 degree field of effect, centered
			on the potion user. User is uneffected. 

	      "attack" 	Indicates that spell is released, centered
			on the potion 'user'. One day, when the 
			throwing code is fixed, the 'user' can include 
			the target of a thrown potion.

	      "self"	Similar to "attack" but no 'visual' effect
			occurs and no others are effected.

	      "golem"	A creature controled by the potion user is
			created. 

	      "create"	Makes an item in the user's square. 

	      "destroy"	Destroys items/creatures surrounding the user.

	      "summon" 	Summons creatures friendly to user, but not 
			strickly controled by the user.


	Looking at the list below, it would appear that the "golem","360"
	and "attack" spells are most likely to work. Real problems seem 
	to exist for casting many of the clerical spells. 

	Unless otherwise noted, all spells work.
